            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>To the moſt Reverend Father in God WILLIAM by Divine Providence, Lord Arch-biſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>Primate and Metropolitan of all</hi> England, <hi>and one of His Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy-Council.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAving compoſed a Treatiſe, <hi>Moſt Reverend Father,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Appearing of the Chief Shepherd of our Souls (whom we look for from Heaven at the laſt day) I know not to whom more properly to addreſs it, than to your Grace: whom our Lord hath been pleaſed to intruſt with the high Office of preſiding in Chief over that part of his Flock which he hath gathered within the
<pb facs="tcp:50236:3"/>Fold of this Kingdom: A charge of which, as your Grace was not in the leaſt ambitious, ſo all judged you highly worthy: and may well look upon it as a token God hath ſtill ſome kindneſs for this Church (which hath been ſo long miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſtracted, and torn in pieces by many ſects and different factions) that He hath been pleaſed to guide His Majeſty to the choice of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo rarely qualified, both with piety and prudence, with upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inflexible vertue, as well as with Learning and other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, to be the Prime Paſtor of it.</p>
            <p>This I am ſure makes ſome Good men hope that He intends ſtill <hi>to feed us in our green Paſtures, and to lead us forth beſide the waters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:</hi> and hath moved me to take the humble boldneſs (among the crowds who come upon that errand)
<pb facs="tcp:50236:3"/>of appoaching your Grace in this manner; to congratulate to your Grace that ſingular honour, and to the Church that great happineſs.</p>
            <p>For the continuance of which, as we ought to pray moſt ardently, ſo to do our duties faithfully in our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtations: and to grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, wherewith in this Church, we are fed ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and ſo abundantly reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. Unto which as nothing can more effectually excite us, than the ſerious contemplation of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again to give Salvation to all the Faithful; and eſpecially to beſtow upon all Faithful Paſtors (who as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, feed his Flock wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and are examples to it) a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away: So I hope I have done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Treatiſe to draw the thoughts and the affections of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:50236:4"/>who piouſly peruſe it, to ſo lovely a ſpectacle.</p>
            <p>Of this your Grace is ſo good a Judge, that it was a Principal motive to my confidence in this Dedication. For next to the pleaſure of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch a work, is the ſatisfaction of addreſſing it to a Patron no leſs Pious than Knowing: who hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed himſelf to devout Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and feels in his own breaſt the ſame holy motions, which he ſees and loves in another. This was a Reflection, wherewith that Great man St. <hi>Hierom</hi> was much delighted, when he was writing his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> In whoſe words I may more fitly end this Preface to your Grace, than he begins one of his (upon the <hi>ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth</hi> Book) unto <hi>Euſtochium.</hi> 
               <q>It is an excellent ſentence of the moſt eloquent Orator, that <hi>Arts would be happy, if none did judge
<pb facs="tcp:50236:4"/>of them but only Artiſts.</hi> And leſt I ſhould ſeem to borrow an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple only from Prophane Writers, this is the very thing which the <hi>Prophet</hi> repreſents in other words, <hi>Bleſſed is he that ſpeaketh in the ears of them that hearken.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>They are the words, I find, of the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> xxv. <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 9. whom he calls a <hi>Prophet</hi> only in a large ſenſe (for in his famous <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logus Galeatus</hi> he ſtrikes this Book out of the Canon of the Scripture) becauſe he had an excellent faculty to compriſe in a few words many profitable inſtructions. Amongſt which St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſeaſonably called this to mind (as he was writing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scriptures, to one that loved them, and was well verſed in them) which is one of the <hi>Ten</hi> things there mentioned by that wiſe man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he thought he might be made compleatly happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50236:5"/>
And of this happineſs (to ſpeak ſtill in the words of that Father) your Grace hath made us partakers: having a palate to taſte what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, as well as to diſcern what is learned and judicious. To the later I do not pretend; but hope there is ſomething of the former, which will recommend this work to your Graces good liking, and make it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable likewiſe to all thoſe that love our Lord Jeſus in ſincerity.</p>
            <p>To whoſe powerful Protection and Guidance I moſt humbly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your Grace; beſeeching Him to ſtrengthen you to ſuſtain the burden of ſo weighty a charge, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire you with all the Prudence, Reſolution and Zeal, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in theſe difficult times: that by your Graces wiſe conduct, Gods true Religion may be ſo ſetled and firmly eſtabliſhed among us, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere piety, together with Chriſtian-Learning
<pb facs="tcp:50236:5"/>and Knowledge ſo thrive and proſper every-where; that this Church (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of that of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi>) may be <hi>your joy and glory, and Crown of rejoycing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

            <head>TO THE Devout Readers.</head>
            <p>SO adorable, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks, is the fulneſs of the holy Scriptures, that the more we ſearch into them, the greater treaſures of Divine Wiſdom we diſcover there to imploy our meditations: and when we think we have found out all that belongs to one ſubject, new things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to fill us with greater joy and admiration. It is not long, ſince I ſent abroad ſo large a Treatiſe of that <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life</hi> which Chriſt hath promiſed, that it ſeemed to comprehend all that the holy Books have delivered in that argument: But upon further thoughts I find, there is one moſt comfortable conſideration ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, which is the ſubject of this preſent Treatiſe. Wherein I have indeavoured to repreſent what a joy it will be to ſee our Lord himſelf come again from Heaven, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with his holy Angels, to fetch us up thither to live with him for ever: and
<pb facs="tcp:50236:7"/>what a Paſſion we ſhould now have for him, and for his coming; whereby we ſhould run to meet him, and receive before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand ſome glimpſes of that glory, wherein he will appear, and we together with him.</p>
            <p>The greatneſs of that Bliſs we ſhall then receive, ought no doubt to be the frequent ſubject of our ſerious Meditation. Which will be the greater (as I have ſaid in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place) becauſe we muſt ſtay ſo long for it, as till the day of Chriſts Appearing. And it is a ſingular comfort, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, to know that it will be ſo exceeding Great: though that very thing cannot but make us the more deſirous, he would be pleaſed to haſten it. For whatſoever joy we ſhall have before that time (as no queſtion the Paradiſe into which our Lord entred immediately after his death, before he was crowned with glory and honour, was a place of very much happineſs) it will not be compleated till he come again to bring us that Great Salvation, which the Scripture ſpeaks of, at the Reſurrection of the dead.</p>
            <p>When we are at reſt from our labours in the other world, I cannot but think we ſhall long for that happy day; and that it
<pb facs="tcp:50236:7"/>will be part of our joy to expect it, with perfect aſſurance of its coming. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot but be a very delightful enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, to <hi>think</hi> of it, to <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>wiſh</hi> for it now, as the greateſt refreſhment we have of our labours, here in this life. For while our thoughts and deſires are thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, we tread, if I may ſo ſpeak, upon the threſhold of Paradiſe, and begin to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the joy of our Lord.</p>
            <p>But there is one expreſſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which I mentioned in the concluſion of the ſecond <hi>Advice to a Friend</hi> (p. <hi>64.</hi>) which excels all the reſt: for he makes it the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per mark of a Chriſtian to <hi>LOVE his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</hi> Which I have undertaken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to explain in this Diſcourſe: that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Chriſtians may know, what the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of that time will be; and what the Affection is we ſhould have for it; and what Reaſon there is, we ſhould be ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards it. The ſubject is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual that I have not ſeen it any where handled; which made me the more willing to ſet about it: that I might in part both ſatisfie the deſire I have to do all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſervice I am able to our Bleſſed Lord and Maſter Chriſt Jeſus; and the
<pb facs="tcp:50236:8"/>delight I take in explaining his holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Of which to be ignorant, is to be ignorant of Chriſt himſelf, as St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s words are, in the beginning of his firſt Book of Commentaries upon <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not expect indeed, nor is it poſſible, that you ſhould have your minds alwayes poſſeſſed with ſuch thoughts, and that your hearts ſhould perpetually burſt out into ſuch paſſions, as I have here expreſſed: I my ſelf cannot think them over again, nor any like them, whenſoever I pleaſe. It is enough, (good Readers) and as much as we can reach, if you be thus affected at certain times, when your ſpirit is moſt ſerious and retired into it ſelf; and if you indeavour to habituate your ſelves to ſuch thoughts and deſires, that they may be ſo familiar and natural, as to become eaſie and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when you will ſtand moſt in need of them.</p>
            <p>More particularly, when the days, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you live, are evil; or when you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any private trouble; or when you would at any time retreat from the world and ſolace your ſelf <hi>in angello cum libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> in a nook with a Book (to ſpeak with
<pb facs="tcp:50236:8"/>
               <hi>Tho. à Kempis,</hi> who thought this the higheſt pleaſure upon earth) or when the Church calls upon you to ſequeſter your ſelf for devotion; and eſpecially when old age you feel creeping upon you, and you think of drawing your ſelves by degrees out of this life: At all ſuch ſeaſons as theſe (and chiefly when you come near to your jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end) this Proſpect cannot but be moſt pleaſant; and ſuch aſpirations and ſighs after the day of Chriſts appearing, be the moſt raviſhing muſick; and to be tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch ardent longings, as are here repreſented, make Afflictions light and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſolitary retirements exceeding ſweet and delightful, old age cheerful, and death it ſelf very comfortable.</p>
            <p>But you muſt not imagine that <hi>Love</hi> can arrive at its higheſt pitch preſently: nor muſt you be troubled or diſcouraged, becauſe you cannot inſtantly, or when you would, raiſe in your ſelves ſuch paſſionate longings after Chriſts appearing. Love is a thing that grows, and, as I may ſay, ſteals upon us by degrees; and the paſſion we feel, at certain ſeaſons, diſpoſes us by little and little to be perfectly in love with that Good, which is ſet before us. A Good
<pb facs="tcp:50236:9"/>ſo great and ſo deſireable, that we do not follow our own beſt inclinations, if we uſe not our utmoſt indeavours to be ſo happy, as to behold that <hi>admirable Countenance</hi> (to ſpeak in the language of St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi>) of our bleſſed Saviour the King of Glory. <q>For if (ſaith he
<note n="*" place="margin">Homil. penult. in S. Johan. <hi>p.</hi> 925.</note>) when we read the ſtory of his life, death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, we are ſo inflamed, that our hearts burn within us, and we wiſh we had lived in thoſe days when he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant on earth, that we might have heard his voice, and ſeen his face, and kept his company, and touched him, and miniſtred unto him: think with your ſelves what it will be to ſee him, not any longer in a mortal body, nor do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humane things, but attended with the hoſts of Angels, when we alſo our ſelves ſhall be freed from this mortality, and, beholding him, ſhall enjoy ſuch fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity as exceeds all expreſſion.</q>

               <p>Let us do all we can, I beſeech you, that we may not miſs of ſo great a glory. There is nothing too hard for us, if we have a will to it: nothing too burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, if our mind be not averſe from it. For if we ſuffer, or endure, we ſhall alſo
<pb facs="tcp:50236:9"/>reign with him. And what is it to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? If we bear afflictions, if we endure perſecutions, if we walk in the narrow way; which to nature indeed is labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but to them who chuſe it and have a good will to it, is light and eaſie, by the hope of things to come. <hi>For our light affliction which is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, works for us a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal weight of glory; whilſt we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at thoſe which are not ſeen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us lift up our eyes then from theſe things here, and direct them towards Heaven; let us imagine always theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen joyes, and look upon them. For if we be converſant with theſe things, we ſhall neither be inticed with the ſweet things of this world, nor ſink under the load of thoſe that are grievous to be born. But we ſhall laugh theſe, and all ſuch like, to ſcorn; and never ſuffer any thing either to depreſs us, or to puff us up: provided we ſtill ſtretch forth that deſire, and look towards that love. What did I ſay, that we ſhall not feel the evil things of this world to be grievous to us? More than that, we ſhall ſcarce mind them, or think
<pb facs="tcp:50236:10"/>that we ſee them. For ſuch is the nature of love, that it makes us imagine we ſee even thoſe who are abſent from us (but much deſired by us) every day with us. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for great is the ſoveraign power, and, as we ſpeak, the tyranny of love. It neglects all things, and tyes the ſoul faſt to thoſe it loves. And therefore if we thus love Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, all things here will ſeem but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but an image, but a dream; and we alſo ſhall ſay, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>I pray God increaſe it, and make it abound more and more in all our hearts; that it may draw continually nearer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its perfection: and make us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to abound in all the fruits of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; which are the higheſt expreſſions of our love, and the beſt preparation for the day of Chriſts Appearing. For true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion doth not terminate in the heart: it goes further, and hath its effect in the life and actions. And eſpecially excites us to love, or charity towards all mankind, and above all to our Chriſtian Brethren; as that which bears the greateſt reſemblance to him whom we love. The Commandment which
<pb facs="tcp:50236:10"/>St. <hi>Paul</hi> charges <hi>Timothy</hi> to keep without ſpot, till our Lords appearing; was, for the moſt part, acts of Charity, as you will find briefly touched in this Book. And therefore theſe we ſhould labour to inliven by our Devotion; which is then truly Great, when it makes us ſo: and raiſes our ſpirits above all anger and peeviſhneſs, covetouſneſs and eager deſire of wealth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and vain ambition, evil ſurmiſes and jealouſies, fretfulneſs and impatience, with all thoſe other mean qualities, which are the enemies of Chriſtian Charity.</p>
            <p>Some Readers perhaps may think, that I ſtrain Devotion here unto too great an height; and may be apt, at the entrance, to lay this Book aſide, becauſe they imagine I have expreſſed that paſſion of love, which we ſhould indeavour after towards Chriſts appearing, beyond the truth: But I muſt intreat them, to do me the right and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the kindneſs, to read on; and they will find in concluſion, the whole deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it made good by the plain words of the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>In the ſtudy of which if we did all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly imploy our ſelves, it is to be
<pb facs="tcp:50236:11"/>hoped God would ſtill preſerve to us that ineſtimable Treaſure: which contains ſuch admirable <gap reason="foreign">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN we obſerve how the deſire of life is ſo deeply fixed in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, both in old and young, in Kings and Beggars, in Wiſe men and Fools, that (as <hi>Lactantius</hi>

We are naturally form'd to wiſh, that we may be ſo happy; and find no
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50236:15"/>thought ſo ſad and diſmal as this, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite extinct, and never enjoying any more pleaſure after we are laid in our graves.</p>
               <p>Upon which account it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that we are infinitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the Grace of God, who hath made that ſo ſure, which is ſo deſirable; and that our Bleſſed Saviour juſtly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges our moſt ardent love and cheerful obedience, whoſe Religion is nothing elſe but an <hi>acknowledgment of the Truth, which is after godlineſs, in hope of eternal life.</hi> They are the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (<hi>Tit.</hi> i. 1, 2.) which import that the Goſpel is a Doctrine which teaches us to be pious, and promiſes to reward our pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with an happy immortality. This is the glorious hope of Chriſtians; whoſe Maſter Chriſt Jeſus (<hi>who is our Hope,</hi> 1. Tim. i. 1.) hath brought life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to light; and made that which was but obſcurely delivered in times paſt, as clear and bright as the Sun at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
               <p>There are ſo many <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of this, that their Teſtimonies have filled a large Volume. The FATHER, the WORD, the HOLY-GHOST, have all declared
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50236:15"/>that <hi>we have eternal life, and this life is in our Saviour, the Son of God.</hi> So ſay the WATER alſo, the BLOOD and the SPIRIT: they all conſent in this Truth, That <hi>Jeſus is alive from the dead, and lives for evermore; and becauſe he lives, we ſhall live alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which welcome news filled the hearts of all thoſe who believed it, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive joy, even when they <hi>were in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs through manifold temptations,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 6, 8. And why it ſhould not have the ſame effect on us, there is no other reaſon can be given, but becauſe we do not believe as they did. For they of whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, had never ſeen our Lord when he was on earth, no more than we; nor had they any ſuch ſight of him, as S. <hi>Stephen</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> had, after he went to Heaven; and yet believing, they <hi>rejoyced with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All our buſineſs therefore is, to ſettle this belief ſtedfaſtly in our minds. Which will have the greater power upon our hearts, when we conſider the abundant grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt towards us, and how excellent the Hope is which he hath given us. For he hath not only
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50236:16"/>aſſured us, that He hath all power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in earth; and that he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the ineſtimable gift of immortality upon us: But that he himſelf will once more come from heaven to crown us with it. <hi>We know</hi> (as I have ſhown in two former Treatiſes) <hi>that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to know him that is true: and This is the true God and Eternal Life,</hi> which he hath revealed to us. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this <hi>firſt coming</hi> to teach us the will of God, to dye for our ſins, and to open to us the Kingdom of Heaven, after He had ſhown us the way to it; He hath bid us believe there is a <hi>Second:</hi> When He will come to judg us by thoſe Laws which he hath left his Church, and to put the obſervers of them into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that Heavenly Kingdom which He hath promiſed.</p>
               <p>And there are none of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> who teſtifie that He is the King of Glory, but aſſure us of this alſo, that He will appear in that glory to take us up unto Himſelf. More eſpecially the HOLY-GHOST, who (as <hi>Epiphanius</hi>

                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Haereſ.</hi> LXXIV. n. 10.</note> admirably ſpeaks) is <hi>the only Guide of Truth, the Expounder of holy Laws, the Inſpirer of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50236:16"/>the Spiritual</hi> (or Chriſtian) <hi>Law, the Leader of the Prophets, the Teacher of the Apoſtles, the Luminary of the Evangelical Doctrines;</hi> He made his Apoſtles and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts clearly underſtand this to be our Saviour's meaning, and authorized them to proclaim this comfortable news to all Believers. Inſomuch that S. <hi>Paul</hi> triumphs in this, when he was ready to be offered for the ſervice of Chriſt, and the time of his departure was at hand, that there was <hi>laid up for him a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the righteous Judg ſhall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them alſo that love his appearing,</hi> 2 Tim. iv. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>In the laſt part of which words there ſeems to me to be contained ſo much of the Chriſtian Hope, that they deſerve to be explained with the ſame care and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that I have beſtowed upon the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CORD which the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> and all the other <hi>Witneſſes</hi> have left us, to teſtifie that Jeſus is the Son of God, and that in Him we have Eternal Life. For as it tranſports all true Believers with joy, to read of a <hi>Crown of Life,</hi> a <hi>Crown of Glory,</hi> a <hi>Crown
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50236:17"/>of Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is laid up ſafe with our Lord in his Heavenly Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as He himſelf and his Apoſtles in this and other places, confidently aſſure us: So it very much raiſes and encreaſes that joyful Hope, to know from their own mouths, that He who hath receiv'd and keeps it ſafely, will condeſcend ſo much as to appear again one day, to confer the very ſame felicity upon us, which He hath obtained himſelf; <hi>who is crowned with glory and honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next to the belief of the truth of this report, there is nothing we are ſo much concerned to know, as who the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are that ſhall wear this Crown, and have their heads eternally honoured with it. Piety it ſelf, indeed, is very apt to perſwade thoſe in whom it lives, that the unfeigned practice of it, ſhall meet at laſt with ſome conſiderable recompence: But that it ſhall receive ſuch a Royal, ſuch a magnificent Reward, as deſerves the name of a Crown of Eternal Glory, is a thing which that great Modeſty and Humility (which is eſſential to true Piety, and its higheſt Ornament and Crown) forbids us to be too forward to conclude. A Perſon perhaps of ſuch eminence and luſtre as S.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50236:17"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> (one of the Stars of the firſt Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude in our Saviour's right hand) may be advanced hereafter to ſhine in ſuch Majeſty: But that we dull heavy ſouls ſhould be thought worthy of the like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, none but a man ſo divinely illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, as He was by the power of the HOLY-GHOST, is ſufficient to ſecure us.</p>
               <p>And, bleſſed be God, we do not want ſuch a Divine Teſtimony. For after this great Apoſtle had related what a courſe he had run, what agonies he had ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with what difficulties he had wreſtled in the ſervice of his bleſſed Maſter Jeſus; and that he nothing doubted but He would remember him at his coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and confer the honour on him which was laid up in Heaven for ſuch victorious ſouls: He encourages all other Chriſtians to comfort themſelves with the ſame expectations, and not imagine they ſhould loſe the Crown (though they came far behind him in the holy race) if they did but LOVE THE APPEAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING

                  <hi>from whence he ſhall come,</hi> &amp;c. But that we may know what kind of <hi>Coming</hi> we are to expect (and not imagine it is meerly by an inviſible power, as he <hi>came</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50236:19"/>
                  <hi>Jeruſalem),</hi> we are to mind how the Apoſtles ſpeak of it as a <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; and teach us to underſtand that word in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, concerning his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appearance to us. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1. xv. 23. (where we firſt meet with this word in the Apoſtolical Writings) that every man ſhall ariſe from the dead, but in due order; <hi>Chriſt the firſt-fruits; and then they that are Chriſts, at his coming:</hi> in perſon that is, as the King and the Judg of the World. For ſo he preſently after directs us to expound the word (xvj. 17.) when he declares the joy he had by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>coming of Stephanas, Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus and Achaicus,</hi> who (as <hi>Theodoret</hi> there notes) were the perſons that brought the Letter to him from the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> In ſuch a manner he believed Chriſt would come; and that he and thoſe Chriſtians he had convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, appearing <hi>before him,</hi> it would prove the greateſt joy and honour to him, to be able to preſent to that great King, ſuch a number of perſons who had been perſwaded by his Miniſtry to become his Subjects, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> ij. 19. In ſhort, this is the word that is uſed in moſt other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50236:19"/>where we read of the <hi>Coming</hi> of Chriſt. And preſently after that laſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (iij. 13.) he tells us, He will come attended <hi>with all his Saints;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will perſonally appear, and ſhew himſelf in that Royal Majeſty wherein He now reigns.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus the ſecond Word ſtill more fully informs us, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the REVELATION <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> or his diſcovering himſelf again to the World, by coming out of that high and holy place where He now lives, but is not ſeen. So <hi>Theophylact</hi> expounds the word both upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 7. and 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> i. 7. where he ſays, the Apoſtle calls the coming of Chriſt, by the name of his <hi>Revelation,</hi> to denote that though He be now with us, yet He is hid, and then ſhall be openly diſcovered. Which he borrows from S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> whoſe words
<note n="*" place="margin">In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 7.</note> are theſe; <hi>The Apoſtle indicates, that though He be not ſeen, yet He is, and is preſent even now; and then will appear,</hi> or ſhow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf viſibly to the world. <hi>Oecumenius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo writes to the ſame effect; and we may ſtill further eſtabliſh this Truth, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering another word of the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with this (and therefore I ſhall not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50236:20"/>mention it diſtinctly by it ſelf) very much uſed by St. <hi>John,</hi> who exhorts his Diſciples to abide in Chriſt, that when <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>He ſhall be made manifeſt,</hi> (or be ſhown to the world) we may not be aſhamed <hi>before him</hi> at his coming, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> ii. 28. So we tranſlate the word in other places (though here it be rendred only <hi>appear),</hi> i. <hi>Joh.</hi> 31. iij. 21. eſpecially in that remarkable place xxj. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. where we read how he <hi>ſhewed himſelf to them</hi> at the Sea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> and that this (<hi>v.</hi> 14.) was the third time that He <hi>ſhewed</hi> or <hi>made himſelf manifeſt</hi> to them, after that He was riſen from the dead. In the very ſame viſible manner will He once more appear; and be as really ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to raiſe us from the dead, and to give us life, as He was <hi>manifeſted in the fleſh</hi> at firſt (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iij. 16), and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>ſhewed himſelf</hi> after his Crucifixion, to be alive from the dead. For though our Life be now <hi>hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> yet when <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is <hi>our Life, ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</hi> or be manifeſted, <hi>then ſhall we alſo appear with him in glory,</hi> iij.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50236:20"/>all as God; though now he be ſo hid, that it is the thing which is objected againſt him, and a pretence for mens unbelief.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe <hi>Theodoret</hi> bids us note, how exceeding appoſitely

               <p n="3">3. For, <hi>lastly,</hi> to make this ſtill more evident, it is called here (in the words I have undertaken to explain) and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places, his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> APPEAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING, in ſo clear and illuſtrious a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids us look for it as <hi>that bleſſed Hope</hi> of Chriſtian people, far more ſplendid than any thing that hath yet been manifeſted. For it is <hi>the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Appearing,</hi> or the appearing of the glory <hi>of the great God and our Saviour,</hi> ij. <hi>Tit.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Which Epithete is to be carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, becauſe it diſtinguiſhes this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing from a former; and teaches us how we are to conceive of it. For every body knows (who hath any skill in theſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50236:21"/>things) that there is, at leaſt, a double <hi>Appearing</hi> of Chriſt ſpoken of in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writings. One paſt, when he came and ſenſibly appeared, and was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in mortal fleſh, for theſe two ends, to preach the Goſpel, and to dye for our ſins. Let the <hi>Reader</hi> conſult the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 10. and ix. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 26. This is called the Appearing of Gods Grace (ij. <hi>Tit.</hi> 11.) which was ſo manifeſted at this time, that it eclipſed all former diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries that had been made of it.</p>
               <p>The other is yet to come; when the ſame Lord will as ſenſibly appear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men according to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have given his Goſpel, and ſhow himſelf as a Royal Prieſt, who hath ſo perfectly expiated our ſins, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered all our Enemies, that He hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then to do, but to give complete Salvation to his Servants. So you read ix. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 28. that to them who expect him, <hi>He will appear the ſecond time</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> make himſelf be ſeen, appear viſibly) <hi>without ſin, unto ſalvation.</hi> As in the former coming He was ſeen in our fleſh, but appeared like a mean perſon, in the form of a ſervant: So in this He will perſonally appear in our Nature; but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50236:21"/>in greater ſplendour, in the form of a Prince; even as the Lord of all the World. And therefore in the firſt verſe of this Chapter (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 1.) <hi>his</hi> KINGDOM and <hi>his</hi> APPEARING, are both put together, as things Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary: And as before, there was an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of his Grace; ſo hereafter he is ſaid to <hi>appear in his Glory,</hi> iij. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>To theſe two <hi>Appearings</hi> ſome add a <hi>Third,</hi> in the middle between them; and that was His appearing to deſtroy <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> and therewith the Perſecutors of his Diſciples: to whom, at that time, it muſt be acknowledged, He gave a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Salvation,</hi> or Deliverance. And the very Truth is, then He is ſaid in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to come, xxj. <hi>Joh.</hi> 22. What if I will that he tarry <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Behold he cometh.</hi> Nay, in a looſer ſenſe of the Word, that time is called by S. <hi>Matthew</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> xxiv. 27, 37, 39. And by S. <hi>Luke</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> xxj. 31. (becauſe then He did exerciſe one part of his Royal Power in puniſhing offenders) But I do not find that in any place it is called the <hi>Revelation,</hi> or the <hi>Appearing</hi> of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50236:22"/>Lord Jeſus. For He did not appear in perſon when he came to deſtroy <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as He did at his firſt coming, and will at his next; but only virtually, in ſuch a deſolation, as made it apparent that His mighty Power was the Author of it.</p>
               <p>There are two places I know alledged by a Great Man, which he thinks ſound this way, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 7. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vj. 14. But it is far more agreeable to the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of thoſe places, to expound them of the <hi>Appearing</hi> we ſtill expect. Of which, we may look upon his coming to deſtroy his Crucifiers, and ſave his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as an Emblem and as a Pledg. For it demonſtrated both the Power of our Lord Jeſus, and his Faithfulneſs to his word: aſſuring us, that He will one day crown the patience and conſtancy of all his Friends with Eternal Life, and puniſh the inſolence of his Enemies with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Fire.</p>
               <p>However, it is paſt all doubt, that in this place I am treating of, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the laſt and greateſt appearing of our Saviour, to finiſh the work of our Redemption, and beſtow the Crown of Righteouſneſs, which is laid up in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50236:22"/>Heaven for all that love him. Which part of our Chriſtian Faith, I have ſhewn, is to be underſtood in this manner: That our Lord will in perſon preſent himſelf once more to the World, and be ſeen at the laſt day to be what he is, the King of Angels and Men, and all Creatures. For as at his firſt coming into the World He <hi>appeared</hi> in our likeneſs (which the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents called his <hi>Epiphany,</hi> a name that ſtill ſticks to the laſt day of the Feaſt of his Nativity) and as He appeared in the ſame likeneſs when He roſe from the dead; and in that form and nature of a man went up into Heaven, and ſtill keeps it there, as ſeveral have ſeen ſince his Aſcenſion: ſo he will in like manner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the end of the world; only in greater Majeſty and Glory as becomes Him <hi>who is over all, God bleſſed for ever, Amen,</hi> ix. Rom. 5.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THERE is nothing to be added to what hath been ſaid, but only this: That the word <hi>Epiphany</hi> or AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEARING denotes not meerly the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting of himſelf in Perſon to the view of all the World; but the whole SHOW (as we call it) that will accompany his coming from Heaven, and all the things that ſhall be done by him, as the Lord and Judge of the World. He ſits now on the Throne of his Glory, and there ſhines in the ſplendor of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and in that Majeſty will one day deſcend from thence into this Air: which the King of Heaven will never ſuffer his Son to do, without a moſt Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Glorious Attendance; ſutable to the quality of his Perſon, and to the dignity of his Office, which is to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:50236:23"/>
This illuſtrious SHOW is deſcribed by our Apoſtle in the 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> iv. 16. where he tells us that firſt of all, <hi>He ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from Heaven,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>with a SHO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T.</hi> That is, with great Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch as uſe to be made when a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Conqueror appears and rides in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. Thus we learn to underſtand it from xlvij. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. where <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>gone up with a SHO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T, the Lord with the ſound of a Trumpet.</hi> That is, the Ark (which was the token of Gods Preſence among them) returned to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> with great and joyful Ovations of all the people, after the conqueſt they got by the Divine aid over their powerful enemies. In ſuch a manner will our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our deſcend, as being about to compleat his Victories by conquering Death it ſelf, <hi>the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> For all the Heavenly Hoſts, we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, will be wonderfully pleaſed to ſee him go forth upon this deſign; and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon each other to perform to him the moſt cheerful ſervice upon that great day, will rejoyce to wait upon him in that moſt glorious Action, and triumph before-hand in the aſſured Victory which he will get over Hell and the Grave.</p>

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50236:24"/>
2. For then, ſaith the Apoſtle, will be <hi>heard the voice of the Archangel;</hi> that is, one of the chief Leaders and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Coeleſtial Hoſts (MICHAEL, I ſuppoſe, the Protector of the Chriſtian Church) ſhall march before his Majeſty: calling aloud to all the reſt of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly company to follow after in their order.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And then will <hi>the Trump of God ſound;</hi> which the Apoſtle adds to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, after the manner of men, the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſummons which will be iſſued forth to alarm all the World to attend at this great ſolemnity. For the gathering of the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> together was by the ſound of a Trumpet, as we find among other places, in iv. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. <hi>Blow ye the Trumpet in the land; cry, gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſay Aſſemble your ſelves.</hi> To which the Apoſtle ſeems to allude, and calls it <hi>the Trump of GOD,</hi> to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from all other; and to expreſs ſuch a mighty and penetrating ſound as ſhall be heard every where: Such an one as is fit to precede none but GOD the Father Almighty himſelf, or Him that holds his place, his only begotten Son, when he comes to judge the World. In
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50236:24"/>ſhort, this ſeems to be an expreſſion bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the appearance of God at Mount
<note n="*" place="margin">So <hi>Then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact</hi> &amp; other <hi>Greek</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> 
                  <hi>Sinai;</hi> whither all <hi>Iſrael</hi> being to be gathered together, they were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned thither by Thunders and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and a thick cloud, and <hi>the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud,</hi> which made all the people tremble, xix. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. So that the meaning of the Apoſtle is, that our Lord ſhall come as the Great King of the World in a moſt venerable Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; which ſhall make all Mankind ſtand in awe of him, and tremble before him, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did at the Appearance of the Divine Majeſty on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> And a great deal more. For,</p>
               <p n="4">4. When he appears, it will be, as I have intimated already, with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable glittering troops of Angels (all clothed in very bright and ſhining Clouds) as his Guard or Retinue to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon him. So we are informed in ſeveral other places: <hi>For the Son of Man</hi> (ſaith our Lord himſelf, xvj. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.) <hi>ſhall come in the glory of his Father, with his Angels, and then he ſhall reward every man according to his works.</hi> Which Saint <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſes thus more fully, ix. <hi>Luk.</hi> 26. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me and of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50236:25"/>my words, of him ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed, when He ſhall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy Angels.</hi> Some of which glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures appeared to the Apoſtles and told them as much, when they ſtood gazing after our Saviour, as He aſcended up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, i. <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>This ſame Jeſus,</hi> ſay they, <hi>which is taken up from you into Heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as ye have ſeen Him go into Heaven.</hi> Now he went thither in a moſt illuſtrious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in the bright Clouds of Heaven, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Coeleſtial Miniſters; who came to conduct him into his Glory. For that is the meaning (it were eaſie to ſhew if this place were proper for it) of thoſe words a little before, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>He was taken</hi> (or lifted) <hi>up, and a cloud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him out of their ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In brief, He will appear as <hi>the Lord of Hoſts; i.e.</hi> of all the Armies of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whether Archangels, or Angels, Thrones, or Dominions, or Powers, or whatſoever other name there is whereby they are called.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And then making the Air his Camp, where he will pitch his Royal Pavilion, a <hi>great White, i.e.</hi> moſt Royal and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50236:25"/>
                  <hi>Throne</hi> will be ſet for Him, (<hi>Revel.</hi> xx. 11.) and leſſer Seats, it is likely, for all thoſe whom He intends to honour at that great day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vj. 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="6">6. After which He will ſend forth his voice, his mighty voice, or moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and irreſiſtible word of Command; the efficacy of which will be ſuch that it will raiſe the dead out of their graves, and bring them before his Throne, or Judgment-ſeat. So He himſelf tells us in v. <hi>Joh.</hi> 28, 29. <hi>The hour is coming in which ALL that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth; they that have done good unto the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the reſurrection of damnation.</hi> Of which Authority and Power of his, He tells them (<hi>ver.</hi> 25.) they ſhould ſhortly have a proof: which was at the Reſurrection of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when He did but ſay with a loud voice, <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> xj. Joh. 43. and immediately he that was dead (as it there follows, <hi>v.</hi> 44.) came forth, though bound hand and foot with grave-clothes.</p>
               <p>In as eaſie a manner will He at the laſt day raiſe up all mankind; who being then gathered before him, and ſtanding
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50236:26"/>at his Tribunal, ſhall be judged and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced by him, to receive every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their works have been, <hi>Rev.</hi> xx. 12, 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 10.</p>
               <p>Some indeed ſhall riſe before others, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> informs us in that 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> iv. 16.) but ſuch ſhall be the concluſion of this Glorious Appearance; which as far as the Holy Scriptures (our only guide in thoſe matters) would direct me, I have briefly explained. For after he hath taken an exact ſurvey of mens actions, and made a juſt diſtinction of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in ſuch ſort as he himſelf hath told us, <hi>Math.</hi> xxv. 31, 32, 33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (where all belonging to this judgment is ſummed up) he will crown the fidelity of his obedient Diſciples: and returning back from the Air (whither they will be caught up in glorious Clouds to meet him) he will carry them along with him to his Heavenly Palace; <hi>And ſo,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſhall we be ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſ. iv. 17.</p>
               <p>And who is there now that would not wiſh to behold him come in this Royal Majeſty; and put ſuch an happy end to all our labours and troubles here? What
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50236:26"/>ſoul is there that can forbear to love and earneſtly deſire this glorious ſight, if it hope to reap advantage by it? This is that on which all good Chriſtians ſhould ſet their hearts. This they ſhould wait and long for, as the moſt lovely ſpectacle, that can bleſs their eyes, whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe God to let it appear. They may be tempted rather to be impatient, becauſe it is ſo long deferred; than to be cold in their affection towards it, or indifferent whether it come or no. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hinder it from raiſing the moſt ardent deſires to enjoy it, unleſs any doubt creep into our hearts, whether there will be ſuch a time as I have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. That diſtruſt indeed, if we have any, muſt firſt be removed. We ought to look after a good aſſurance of the certainty of that, which we make the object of our love, and moſt paſſionate expectations.</p>
               <p>For if we expect a SHOW, that is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly painted in our own fancies, in curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous colours, but hath no real exiſtence any where elſe, what an amazing diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment will it be to find we have ſet our hearts on that which is not, and have embraced a Cloud inſtead of God? How
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50236:27"/>miſerable ſhould we feel our ſelves, if at laſt we perceived that we had preſſed a dream, and with long out-ſtretched arms (as I may ſpeak) moſt ardently claſpt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a ſhadow? Into what a gulph of ſhame ſhould we tumble, if we ſaw in the concluſion and iſſue of things, the whole weight of our ſouls and moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affections fall upon the thin air, and have nothing to ſupport them? Nothing can expreſs the confuſion it would throw us into, to find that we had courted, ſo many years or ages perhaps, a meer vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our own hearts; and let our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection looſe to wander in the paradiſe of fools.</p>
               <p>That we may be out of fear therefore of any ſuch diſappointment; and have our affections powerfully excited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſo great a good, and be engaged moſt earneſtly to purſue it; I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the <hi>ſecond part</hi> of this Diſcourſe, which is to ſhew the grounds we have to expect the APPEARING of the Lord Jeſus the ſecond time unto our eternal Salvation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>The certainty of this APPEARING of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TO prove that there will certainly be ſuch an APPEARING of our Lord, as will ſurpaſs even the Glory wherein the Apoſtles ſaw him on the Holy Mount (which St. <hi>Luke</hi> plainly ſhews was a figure of it, ix. <hi>Luk.</hi> 26, 27, 28.) I might alledge all thoſe Arguments which aſſure us there will be a day wherein God will judge the World in righteouſneſs; and that the Lord Jeſus is ordained to be the Perſon by whom he will judge it. Which is as much as to ſay, that all thoſe Arguments which prove him to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> might be employed to this purpoſe; for in that Name is included (as I have ſhewn in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treatiſes) His power and authority to be the Judge of the World. This the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the other WITNESSES on Earth, as well as thoſe in Heaven, teſtifie to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50236:28"/>Truth; and therefore I might from every one of their mouths demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that He ſhall appear again in ſuch a manner as I have deſcribed. For all Judges, much more the ſupreme Judge of all, ever aſcend their Tribunals in Robes of State, and royally attended; as thoſe that repreſent the Majeſty for whom they judge.</p>
               <p>But it would be too tedious to follow that Method, and it is not needful I ſhould lead you ſo far about to bring you and this Truth together. There is one place in the writings of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which if well expounded and underſtood, will be ſufficient to perſwade us, we do not abuſe our ſelves with vain expectations of this <hi>Appearing.</hi> And therefore with the explication of that (which contains divers Arguments to eſtabliſh us in this belief) I ſhall content my ſelf, without having recourſe to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of thoſe WITNESSES. And I ſhall the rather confine my ſelf to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſhall illuſtrate a very conſiderable portion of Gods Holy Book (which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions we ought to deſign to make perſpicuous) while I endeavour to give ſatisfactory reaſons, that our Lord
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50236:28"/>Jeſus will appear again, and in ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a manner as hath been related.</p>
               <p>It is in his former Epiſtle to this very Perſon, his beloved Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> Chap. vj. where he charges him (<hi>v.</hi> 13, 14.) to keep the Commandment he had given him without the leaſt violation of it, <hi>until the APPEARING of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That is, till his coming from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with all the glorious train of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to recompenſe men according to their works. Now that <hi>Timothy</hi> might be fully perſwaded there would be ſuch a bleſſed time, and to be more ready and cheerful in his obedience to this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the Apoſtle aſſures him that this is no ſuch ſpectacle as is formed meerly in the imagination: but which God the Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth will real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhibit in his time. So the words are (<hi>v.</hi> 15, 16.) <hi>Which</hi> (Appearing) <hi>in his times He ſhall ſhew, who is the bleſſed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: who only hath Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, dwelling in the light, which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath ſeen nor can ſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where we are firſt to obſerve well thoſe words which begin this deſcription
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50236:29"/>of Him who will ſhew our Lord Chriſt in ſuch excellent Glory, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in his times</hi> (we render it), or rather <hi>in the proper ſeaſons</hi> for it. That is, in the time or ſeaſon which God in his unſearchable Wiſdom hath appointed. From which phraſe <hi>three</hi> things offer themſelves to our conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the time, indeed, of this APPEARING is not revealed and made known to us. We muſt be content to be ignorant of it; for it is kept as a ſecret in his own breaſt, and it becomes not us to determine the ſeaſon which he hath reſerved to himſelf. Some great men, it is true, have adventured upon it; and Saint <hi>Hilary,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Canon xvij. in <hi>Matth.</hi>
                  </note> for inſtance, hath delivered his opinion, that the Transfiguration of our Lord, <hi>Six days after he had ſpoken of his coming in his Kingdom</hi> (xvij. Mat. 1.) prefigured the <hi>Honour of the Coeleſtial Kingdom,</hi> (as his words are) after the World had continued ſix thouſand years. But this and the current fancy among many in ancient times, that becauſe the World was ſix days in making it ſhould laſt juſt ſix thouſand years, had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter foundation than thoſe miſapplied words of St. <hi>Peter</hi> 2. iij. 8. <hi>That one day
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50236:29"/>with the Lord is as a thouſand years.</hi> And therefore it is deſervedly cenſured by St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (upon xc. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.) as a preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption reprehended by our Lord himſelf, when he told his Apoſtles, (i. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.) <hi>It is not for you to know the times or the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</hi> And yet there have been thoſe who would needs be medling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this from no better reaſon than the Tranſlation of <hi>Enoch,</hi> who was the ſeventh from <hi>Adam.</hi> And there is one of great note in theſe later times (to name no more) who hath been ſo bold as from a ſlighter ground to conjecture the time of the Coming of our Lord. Who having ſaid in iv. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. that according to <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Prophecy he was come <hi>to preach the acceptable year of the Lord,</hi> or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a <hi>Jubilee</hi> to the World, <hi>Cuſanus</hi> thence concluded that for every year of our Saviours life, the Church ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a Jubilee, that is fifty years. And therefore he riſing again in the 34th. year of his Age, the Church ſhould have its bleſſed Reſurrection when the 34th. Jubilee was paſt: That is, after the year 1700. before the year 1734. which he endeavours to make more probable from
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50236:30"/>the ſimilitude of the flood, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, he obſerves, uſes when he ſpeaks of his coming: Fancying that as from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to the deſtruction of the World by water, there paſſed according to <hi>Philo</hi> juſt 34. Jubilees; ſo there ſhall be the like number of years from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> to the conſumption of it by fire. There are ſeveral other little fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies whereby he ſtudies to ſtrengthen this conceit: But I ſhall not mention them, becauſe as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced again in another place,
<note place="margin">Epiſt. LXXVIII.</note> from that ſaying of our Saviour before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, it is better to confeſs our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, than to profeſs a falſe knowledge. And this we have reaſon to think is no better, becauſe ſuch ſupputations of the times, as he ſpeaks, that we may know when will be the end of the World, and the coming of the Lord, ſeem to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a deſire to know that which he himſelf hath ſaid, the Father hath reſerved only to himſelf. Which words our Saviour did not ſpeak, becauſe he was ignorant of the time about which the Apoſtles enquired, but (as <hi>Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> well notes) becauſe it would contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute nothing to their ſalvation to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50236:30"/>with it. And it is the office of an excellent Maſter to teach, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not what the Scholars deſire, but what it is profitable for them to learn. This was the only reaſon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to ſatisfie them; for he himſelf knew very well the times and ſeaſons, as the ſame Writer adds, becauſe, <hi>All that the Father hath is the Sons alſo.</hi> Now,</p>
               <p>We are to conſider (in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place) that God the Father hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and ſet down a time for this <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing</hi> of his Son Jeſus, though he hath not thought fit to have us acquainted with it. It is not the leſs certain, becauſe he hath not revealed when it will be; ſince he hath fore-appointed in his own ſecret counſel, a ſeaſon proper for this buſineſs. This ought to give no ſmall ſtrength to our Faith and Hope; for we are wont always to make the ſurer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a thing, and look for it the more confidently; when we know there is a time limited and prefixed for its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle indeed ſuppoſes (which is the <hi>third</hi> thing) that many Ages might paſs before this appointed time arrived; but yet it will not fail to come at laſt.

And if we obſerve the uſe of the very ſame phraſe in another place of this Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> ij. <hi>v.</hi> 6.

                  </gap>, <hi>in due ſeaſon,</hi> as we there tranſlate it) we cannot well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it any other meaning in this. For there it ſignifies that our Lord at laſt did give a moſt memorable teſtimony of the exceeding great Grace of God, though ſeveral Ages were paſſed by (ſince the firſt promiſe made of his coming) before he appeared in fleſh to die for us: And therefore here in all reaſon it muſt be conceived to denote the revolution of ſeveral Ages more, from that firſt coming of his till the ſecond Appearing in aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Glory; as <hi>Oecumenius</hi> juſtly calls it.</p>
               <p>How many Ages we cannot tell; and ſome of thoſe who thought heretofore they could tell, committed ſo groſs an error in their account, that it hath taught poſterity to be more cautious in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining any thing about it. They I mean who fancied the World ſhould continue juſt ſix thouſand years, following the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50236:31"/>Computation of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlators of the Bible, brought this period to an end many Ages ago. <hi>Lactantius</hi> for inſtance tells us (and it is above thirteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſince he died) that <hi>poſt breve tempus</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">L. VII. Divin. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. C. 14.</note>, after a ſhort time they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the concluſion of all things. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they varied in their account, and could not agree in the exact ſumme of the years that were ſtill to come, yet <hi>Omnis expectatio non ampliùs, quàm du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centorum videtur annorum</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. Cap. 25.</note>, in this they ſeemed all to conſent that they would not exceed two hundred years. But St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> lived to confute theſe conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; and ſaith that according to his reckoning this period of ſix thouſand years was out in his days. And ſhould we follow the Computation of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> perhaps we ſhould not come nearer to the mark if we ſtill depended on ſuch expectations: but after theſe ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years are indeed expired, there may be a great number for any thing we know ſtill to come before the end of all things. Which notwithſtanding ſhould be no diſcouragement to us, as long as it is ſure and certain He will come: the time being ſet, and He who hath prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50236:32"/>it being ſo qualified, that no doubt He will ſhow our Saviour in all his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <gap reason="foreign">

For as there was a fulneſs of time (iv. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.) when it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our Saviour ſhould firſt appear, after they had waited many Ages for him: ſo there is no doubt the like time ſet for his laſt appearing, and the conſummation of all things; though it may be long before it be fulfilled.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50236:32"/>Apoſtle to confirm this Faith in <hi>Timothy,</hi> and to work it in us; that He will not fail in his times to bring our Saviour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain out of his holy place, and make Him appear in ſuch a manner as they preached.</p>
               <p>The grounds of their preaching it was that (firſt of all) our Saviour had made them a ſolemn promiſe before He left them, that He would return and take them up to the ſame place whither He was going, xiv. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>I go to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for you. And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you unto my ſelf, that where I am there you may be alſo.</hi> And (2.) the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels likewiſe had added their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſince He went to Heaven, to the truth of this promiſe. For as they were looking after Him when they ſaw Him aſcend, two of them ſtood by them and ſaid, <hi>This ſame Jeſus which you ſaw taken up into Heaven, ſhall ſo come in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ye have ſeen him going into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> i. <hi>Act.</hi> 11. And (3.) after this the Holy Ghoſt came, which was the fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a promiſe ſomething like to this, xvi. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. <hi>A little while and ye ſhall ſee me, and again a little while and ye ſhall
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50236:33"/>not ſee me, becauſe I go to my Father.</hi> This was the Deputy of our Saviour (as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſpeaks) and the teſtimony of his Preſence; by whom he viſited them, and came again to ſee them (<hi>v.</hi> 22.) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his word: And the other promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they concluded would be as certainly made good as this was. But (laſtly) St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a greater reaſon ſtill to preach this, becauſe he had received an expreſs warrant and command from our Lord Chriſt himſelf, ſince He went to the Throne of his Glory, to declare that He would come again in all that pomp and royal Majeſty which the Apoſtle deſcribes in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iv. 16, 17.

               <p>Now ſee upon what ſolid reaſons and ſure foundations the Apoſtle perſwades <hi>Timothy</hi> to believe that God the Father will perform this promiſe of our Lord and Saviour; whom it is apparent He ſent, and hath therefore highly exalted, becauſe he never ſaid nor did any thing but what He commanded Him.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Firſt, He tells him that there will no doubt be ſuch a glorious appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe He who will ſhew him in his ſplendor is <gap reason="foreign">

And therefore (1.) cannot be tempted out of any envy (with which none but penurious beings are capable to be infected) to deny us this exceeding great favour. But rather (2.) will be moved by his plenitude and his bountiful nature to communicate it to us, according to our
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50236:34"/>Saviours promiſe. Eſpecially (3.) ſince He hath already advanced him to the higheſt bliſs and happineſs; and can ſo eaſily without any damage to himſelf, make all others bleſſed, who are faithful to him. And (4.) is unchangeable alſo (which <hi>Theodoret</hi>

               <p>They that have but a little may be loth to give; and they who have any defect may be unwilling that any ſhould approach too nigh their Greatneſs: For wanting ſomething themſelves they may be beſt pleaſed when they ſee that others do ſo too; and they may find that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in breaking, which they could not have done in keeping their word. But He that wants nothing, nor is lyable to any diminution of what he hath (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in full perfect poſſeſſion of all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pleaſure and bliſs) can never be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to impart good things to others; nor deſirous they ſhould be leſs happy, than their natures are capable to be; nor tempted to go back with his word, when he hath engaged himſelf to do them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50236:34"/>good. No, rather quite contrary; He takes a pleaſure in filling others out of his exuberant goodneſs, and cannot be inclined to be more forward to make very gracious Promiſes than he is to make them good to thoſe who patiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the performance.</p>
               <p>Thus we cannot but believe when we reflect upon his Bleſſedneſs. Eſpecially when we conſider withal that he is <gap reason="foreign">

Which power of his, is denoted by that word <hi>[only]</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, originally inherent in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not derived from any other: for which cauſe there can be no defect in it, nor can it ever grow leſs than it is.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral other <hi>Potentates,</hi> it's true, both in Heaven and in Earth; but whatſoever power, might, or authority there is in them, it is derived intirely from him, as the ſource and fountain of it.

It hath no higher cauſe, and therefore is inſeparable from him; and can never be either wholly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or in the leaſt impair'd and weakned. No, He continues always as He ever was, the Rock of our ſtrength, and of our Salvation: (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, lxij. <hi>Pſal.</hi>) on whom our Souls may build a moſt ſure hope; which ſtands on ſuch a bottom as no power whatſoever can ſhake.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50236:35"/>greateſt rank, as well as over other inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Creatures. They are all ſo much below him, and ſo perfectly ſubject to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that the ſtrongeſt and moſt mighty oppoſers that can be imagined, have no power to do any thing to hinder this glorious appearance. A force like that of the <hi>Perſian, Aſſyrian,</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings, (who were all wont to ſpeak in this lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtile) is not ſo conſiderable to him as ſo many flyes would be to them: No, nor if we ſhould ſuppoſe a power that could claim a juſt title to the Government of the Univerſe; would it be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the will of Him to whom alone this great Name of <hi>KING of KINGS</hi> doth properly appertain. Nay more than this, ſhould all the Hoſts of Heaven combine together in a confederacy to join with all the forces on Earth, aſſembled in one body under their ſeveral Princes and Chieftains, they could not by all their reſiſtance defeat his Decree which he hath paſſed for the Coming of our Lord.</p>
               <p>And yet we are not to make any ſuch ſuppoſal, becauſe they all obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and are obedient to the voice of his Word. And as for thoſe Creatures (be they never ſuch Principalities and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50236:36"/>Powers in high places, vi. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 12.) which will not now obey Him, they ſhall not be able at that time to gain-ſay his Soveraign will: But they ſhall attend, whether they will or no, upon this Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Perſon, Chriſt Jeſus. The good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, thoſe Coeleſtial <hi>Lords,</hi> (whether Thrones or Dominions, or whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name of authority there is above) and all inferior Governours, the Gods upon Earth, (Emperours, Kings, Princes, and Judges of the World) together with thoſe evil Angels who are called <hi>the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the darkneſs of this World;</hi> they ſhall all appear either with or before our Saviour; according as the GREAT KING ſhall appoint, who hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſhow him; for He is the ſupream Lord and Ruler of them all.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And ſuch a ſupereminent King (as the Apoſtle goes on) is He who ONLY HATH IMMORTALITY: that is, lives for ever to make good what he hath promiſed, which cannot be ſaid of any but of himſelf. Earthly Kings are as weak and mortal as their ſubjects: And ſo all their promiſes (though they intend never ſo ſeriouſly to perform them, and have power for the preſent to do it) may fail
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50236:36"/>and come to nought, becauſe they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may fail and return unto their duſt. And <hi>in that very day,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxlvi. 4. <hi>their thoughts periſh;</hi> that is, all their deſigns, counſels and purpoſes, with all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and great hopes that depend upon them, die together with thoſe that made them. But that Great King, the Lord of Lords, who hath immortality, and who <hi>only</hi> hath it; that is, of Himſelf, and not from any ones gift and favour (being the Lord as I ſaid of Angels as well as of our ſpirits, which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have not Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but partake of it, by the grace of Him who alone by nature is immortal
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact</hi> and <hi>Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
                  </note>) He I ſay may be confided in and relyed upon: Becauſe, He neither wanting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor being ſubject to death or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, none of his counſels and purpoſes can be defeated. No promiſe of His can fall to the ground in proceſs of time; becauſe He lives then in all ſucceeding Ages, as much as He did at that moment when He paſſed it.</p>
               <p>And beſides this, it is very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that having immortality of Himſelf, (which the Apoſtle means as I noted juſt now, when he ſaith He only hath it) He can grant this benefit to us, even to our
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50236:37"/>Bodies, as he hath done to the Angels, and to our bleſſed Lord and Saviour. Who ſaith concerning himſelf, i. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> am alive from the dead) <hi>and behold I am alive for evermore, Amen;</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> there is nothing more certain) <hi>and have the keys of hell and of death.</hi> Power, that is, to open the graves of others, and promote them to Immortality with my ſelf.</p>
               <p>And there is no reaſon to fear leſt our Saviour ſhould not come and appear to do this; though it may be a great way off, and many Centuries of years have paſſed ſince He gave us his word for it: Becauſe God the Father Almighty, the bleſſed and only Potentate, who autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized Him to make this promiſe, and hath ſince that raiſed him from the dead, is immortal, and hath an indefectible life in himſelf, of his own nature. His will, as I have ſaid, doth not alter, and his power cannot be impaired, or ſuffer any decay; and therefore He can and will continue and perpetuate the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom He hath given to our bleſſed Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator Chriſt Jeſus; and keep him in full power and authority till that great day: And when the fulneſs of time is come,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50236:37"/>bring Him again upon the ſtage of the World (if I may ſo ſpeak) and ſhew Him openly as the great Lord of all; whom He hath honoured already with his own high title of KING OF KINGS, and LORD OF LORDS, xix. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. All this is as eaſie for Him to do, as it was at firſt to raiſe him out of his grave, and then advance him to the Throne of his Glory; where he now ſits at the right hand of the Majeſty on high.</p>
               <p>And there is the greater reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that He will both perpetuate the Kingdom of Chriſt to the worlds end, and conclude it with the glorious exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his ſubjects, when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear again; (it being no more difficult than it was to carry him to heaven) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as the Apoſtle further notes:</p>
               <p n="5">V. HE DWELLS IN LIGHT INAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSIBLE; which no man, that is, can enter into, or approach. This ſignifies the inconceivable brightneſs of the Divine Majeſty; both as to His Eſſence which cannot by us be comprehended; and as to the place where He more eminently manifeſts Himſelf in an amazing ſplendor. He is the Great King who lives above in the higheſt Heavens, as in His Palace;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50236:38"/>where he repreſents Himſelf in a Glory ſo ſhining and dazeling (called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his <hi>Majeſty</hi>) that it is not for ſuch as we (till there be a marvellous change wrought in us) to come nigh it.</p>
               <p>Nor is it ſo beſeeming that He ſhould deſcend Himſelf from thence in that moſt Glorious MAJESTY to judg the World, and to transform all thoſe who ſhall be <hi>accounted worthy to obtain that better world, and the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> And therefore we may be confident our Bleſſed Saviour, who long ago was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be the perſon, will, according to his word, come as His Commiſſioner to do it in his ſtead. It is not ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to His ſtate and greatneſs (if I may ſo expreſs it) to come Himſelf out of His Orb of Light to fetch us to his houſe and dwelling-place: But ſince He hath appointed a day of recompences, we may be ſure He will ſend his Son in <hi>the glory of the Father,</hi> as he tells us, ix. <hi>Luk.</hi> 26. (that is, in a <hi>Majeſty</hi> like that I now ſpake of) <hi>and in the glory of his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> (who uſe to attend him) to meet us and conduct us ſafely thither.</p>
               <p>Or we may conceive of this expreſſion, after this manner: GOD (the Father,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50236:38"/>that is, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt) is in that high and holy place, the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary above; into which no man hath yet entred, ſave only the great High-Prieſt of our Salvation, the Lord Jeſus. And yet GOD hath made us a promiſe by him, before He went to heaven, that we alſo ſhall live with Him, and be there where He is. From whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this great High-Prieſt will certainly come in his Royal Majeſty, out of that place into which He is gone; <hi>to bleſs us,</hi> by bringing us to that region of Light and Glory, which He himſelf only as yet inherits; and which is not any way acceſſible, but only by his means. In whoſe power, we may be ſatisfied, it is to promote us thither, being in ſuch favour with the Divine Majeſty, and ſitting at His right hand: who <hi>inhabits,</hi> or poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes this glorious place, as His own proper <hi>Dwelling,</hi> and therefore can diſpoſe of a Manſion in it, to whom He pleaſes.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. And indeed the Apoſtle bids us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, (which is the laſt thing) that <hi>no man hath SEEN GOD, nor CAN SEE HIM;</hi> is capable, that is, to be in his glorious preſence. Which ſignifies partly the ſame with the former; and alſo may
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50236:39"/>ſuggeſt among other things the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Him, who hath promiſed to ſhow us this Appearing of Chriſt Jeſus; of GOD, that is, the Father Almighty. Who we ſee here plainly is the perſon of whom the Apoſtle hath, all this time, been ſpeaking (as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> alſo, if his gloſs be well weighed, underſtand him) not of our Saviour: who hath been ſeen already and ſhall be ſeen again at his ſecond appearing. And you know, He hath promiſed to the <hi>pure in heart</hi> that they <hi>ſhall SEE GOD,</hi> v. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. A favour which in this ſtate no man hath enjoyed or can enjoy, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> here tells us. It is not for ſuch as we to <hi>ſee God;</hi> and therefore there muſt be a time, when, according to his faithful promiſe, Chriſt Jeſus ſhall appear again; to change us, and put us in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that He may bring us to that ſight of Him, which no man in this World can have.</p>
               <p>Either we muſt remain for ever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſight of Him; (and then God would not be true, who hath ſaid by His Son that we ſhall ſee him) or we muſt be carried up from hence unto His heavenly Palace; and then our Lord
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50236:39"/>muſt appear to fit us for it, and make us capable of ſuch a bleſſedneſs, and to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport us thither.</p>
               <p>For how we ſhould otherways be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to a place ſo much above us, but by the coming of our Lord, to lift us up, and promote us to it, we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: Since this is the way that He hath deſcribed; and our Lord Jeſus is to have the honour of doing all the good to his faithful ſervants, which GOD in his infinite goodneſs deſigns to beſtow upon them.</p>
               <p>This I take to be intimated in theſe words <hi>[Whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee]</hi> which declare ſtill more fully than was ſaid before, the ſuper-eminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence and perfection of the Divine Nature, and the aſtoniſhing brightneſs of his Majeſty. Which, whilſt we are here, we cannot reach, or attain any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſight of; and therefore Chriſt Jeſus, who hath promiſed we ſhall ſee Him, will appear again to fit us for converſation with Him.</p>
               <p>And indeed, ſince God hath already fulfilled his promiſe of the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of His Son; and ſent Him, born of a Woman, to bring the glad tydings of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50236:40"/>Salvation to us (by which he did, in one ſenſe, make us <hi>ſee God;</hi> that is, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand His Mind, Counſels and Will, i. <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.): and ſince another promiſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of his coming to deſtroy his Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers (when <hi>every eye,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>ſhould ſee him,</hi> i. Rev. 8. that is, his power and glory at Gods right hand, ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly thereby manifeſted to the world) is punctually and exactly made good: What reaſon have we to doubt of the certainty of his other appearing, which is ſtill behind; when we ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him perſonally preſent with us, to bring us nearer into the very preſence of God?</p>
               <p>We have the ſame word paſſed for it, which they had for the other: he hath the ſame Will, the ſame Power, the ſame Empire and Soveraign Dominion; And therefore why ſhould we not have the ſame confidence, and expect it with as much and full aſſurance, as Holy men in old times waited for the firſt Conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or pious Chriſtians waited for deliverance from their Adverſaries?</p>
               <p>There is ſo little cauſe that our Faith ſhould think it ſelf leſs aſſured than theirs, that we may rather look for this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50236:40"/>ſecond appearing of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, with much greater confidence than they could do for the firſt: Becauſe we have the advantage of ſeeing all thoſe old Prophecies which foretold his Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation in our fleſh, actually fulfilled; and the Lord hath ſhown ſince that, <hi>how upright He is, and that there is no unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in Him.</hi> We may depend not only (as the Apoſtle hath here told us) upon His Goodneſs and perfect Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, upon his Power, upon his abſolute Dominion over all Creatures whatſoever, upon his Immortality, upon his tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Glory and Majeſty, and upon his Faithfulneſs and Truth: but I may add, upon the evident Demonſtrations he hath already given in the moſt remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that <hi>His Mercies are ſure;</hi> and that he <hi>keepeth Truth for ever,</hi> xiii. Acts 34. cxlvi. Pſal. 6.</p>
               <p>For this Bleſſed and only Potentate, this King of kings, and Lord of lords, who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, whom no man hath ſeen or can ſee, <hi>hath done great things for us already, whereof we are glad.</hi> He hath ſent his Son after good men had long expected Him;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50236:41"/>He ſent Him to do for them more than they expected (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ij. 9.); He raiſed him up out of his Grave, and made him Lord of all; He hath given him power to raiſe up us to eternal life (as appears by the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, which wrought in his Apoſtles, and enabled them to raiſe the dead, and do many other wonders); <hi>His Judgments alſo have already been made manifeſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. vi. 10. xi. 15. xv. 4.</note> He hath in part avenged the blood of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and the <hi>Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ.</hi> And therefore we may with a ſtedfaſt Faith look for another appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour, when he will come in perſon to exerciſe this power himſelf (wherewith we ſee he is inveſted) ſo far, as to <hi>change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body</hi> (which then he will ſhow to the world) <hi>according to the working whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf,</hi> iii. Phil. 20, 21.</p>

               <p>To this we ſhould every one of us, together with the Apoſtle, moſt heartily ſay AMEN: Let be ſo. We give our

Nay, what though No man can ſee Him? Yet Glory, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Power is to be aſcribed to Him, becauſe we ſee his works of Wonder every where. The Heavens and the Earth declare the greatneſs of his glory; and from all things that we behold, we learn his rich Goodneſs, his infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, his immortal Bliſs; and that He is ſuch a Potentate, as the greateſt Kings and Princes upon earth, nay the higheſt Thrones and Principalities in Heaven, ought to worſhip and obey with the greateſt reverence. And much more is this due from us, poor and inferior crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: eſpecially ſince He hath ſhown Himſelf ſo gracious to us in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our (the moſt excellent demonſtration of his bleſſed Nature and mighty Love) and hath promiſed He ſhall appear once more in greater glory than ever; and hath taught us to believe, by all the Notions we have of Him, that He will never fail to make that promiſe good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:50236:43"/>
And as we ought to Honour God the Father of all; ſo this naturally moves us (out of a particular obligation) to honour and obey our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the Perſon whom this Great Majeſty will ſhow in wonderful honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at the great day.</p>
               <p>This is the very reaſon (you muſt mark) wherewith the Apoſtle backs his Charge to <hi>Timothy</hi> to keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he gave him, <hi>without ſpot, unrebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, until the appearing of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> v. 14. becauſe the bleſſed and only Potentate will certainly, in his own time, ſhew the glory wherein He lives, by his appearing again in Royal Majeſty in the ſight of all the World. It concerns us therefore, as well as it did <hi>Timothy,</hi> to have an exceeding great regard to this moſt glorious Perſon, whom God will ſo highly honour; and to take care that we behave our ſelves ſo, as to be unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable at that day. We muſt obſerve His Commandments, that is, as exactly as we can; and endeavour to render our ſelves as a beautiful body, without any ſpot and blemiſh; and thereby be found acceptable in His ſight, at His appearing.</p>
               <p>And if you would know what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50236:43"/>they were which He would have <hi>Timothy,</hi> in conſideration of this appearing of Chriſt, and the certainty thereof, to keep without ſpot; you need but look back to the <hi>eleventh</hi> and <hi>twelfth</hi> verſes, and there you may find them. <hi>Follow after righteouſneſs, godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, faith, love, patience, meekneſs: Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art alſo called,</hi> &amp;c. <q>That is, Shun Covetouſneſs, and all the vices that iſſue from it, ever ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to every man what is his due: Have God always before thine eyes, and put thy truſt and confidence in him; Deceive no man that relies on thy word; exerciſe mercy and charity to all; ſuffer wrongs rather than do them; and ſuffer them with a patient humble mind; bridle anger, repreſs all Cholerick motions; and uſe ſuch gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs to others, as thou wouldſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thy ſelf in the like caſes. And for this end, contend earneſtly for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith; that is, ſuffer not thy faith in Chriſt to be ſhaken, much leſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by any perſecution, pain, or death it ſelf. As thou haſt begun to ſhow thy ſelf a good Chriſtian, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50236:44"/>Remember thy Calling and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and reſolve to quit all thou haſt, rather than fall ſhort of Eternal Life. And this I give thee in charge (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) as thou wilt anſwer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, who raiſes even the dead; and before our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who conſtantly profeſſed the truth before <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi> that thou keep theſe things inviolable, and endeavour to be found pure and holy when Chriſt ſhall appear again: As certainly He will; for we have his word for it, and God the bleſſed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is able, and lives for ever to make it good.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two Uſes, you ſee, the Apoſtle plainly directs us to make of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine here delivered. And there is a <hi>Third,</hi> which he teaches us in the place I am now treating of; when he deſcribes all good Chriſtians who <hi>keep the faith,</hi> by the Name of thoſe who <hi>LOVE this AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEARING</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>All they who obſerve the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Lord and Saviour with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs and care, ought to ſet their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50236:44"/>hearts upon this glorious appearing which they expect; as the moſt goodly ſight, the moſt bleſſed ſpectacle that eyes can behold.

Which diſpoſes and inclines all thoſe that heartily embrace it, and live according to it, to have a great affection for that happy day, which ſo many pious ſouls, through ſo many Ages, have moſt paſſionately longed to ſee. So <hi>Andreas Caeſarienſis</hi> hath moſt excellently expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſenſe of all right Chriſtians, when he ſets this down for the Contents of the laſt Chapter of the <hi>Revelation</hi> (according to the old diviſion

               <p>I Have paſſed over the other two with the greater ſpeed, becauſe I intend to take the more pains in this; by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſhow, and to expreſs as lively as I can, what the LOVE is which we ſhould bear to this <hi>Appearing,</hi> if we hope to partake in the comforts of it. And how to do this better, than by deſcribing the original and progreſs of this paſſion, I cannot deviſe. And therefore I ſhall uſe that Method for the conveying this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Chriſt into your minds under ſuch a notion and character, as ſhall not fail to ſtir up in your heart the devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affection for it.</p>

                  <p>Let it then in the firſt place be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that there cannot be the leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50236:46"/>of this love, unleſs we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the appearing of our Saviour as a GOOD, and that of the greateſt <hi>ſize.</hi> For elſe it will be ſo far from touching us with any inclinations towards it, that it will excite either our hatred, or our contempt of it. It is the <hi>GOOD</hi> which we diſcern in any thing, that charms our ſouls, and attracts our deſires. Though an object be never ſo near us, and preſent it ſelf to our very hands, and would thruſt it ſelf upon us; yet if we ſee no good in it, we either hate it for diſturbing our quiet, or at leaſt are perfectly cold to it, as feeling no power it hath to ſtir up any paſſion for it. Nay, though we do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a thing to be good for us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firable to be enjoyed; yet if it ſtand at ſuch a great diſtance, and ſeem ſo very far off, as the <hi>Appearing</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt for any thing we know may be, it will not ſenſibly affect our hearts, nor move us to bear much regard to it, unleſs it have the face of a very great happineſs, and promiſe us exceeding much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Appearing</hi> therefore of our Lord, is called by this Apoſtle in another place, li. <hi>Tit.</hi> 13. <hi>that</hi> BLESSED HOPE; to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50236:46"/>expreſs the incomparable happineſs and bliſs, which it will bring along with it. He would have us look upon it as a thing that far more imports us, than all our preſent enjoyments, or all that is poſſible to be here enjoyed. For there is nothing in this world that is worthy to be ſpoken of with ſuch an Emphaſis, as to be called <hi>that bleſſed thing,</hi> that happy poſſeſſion. This is a peculiar reſpect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing only to the appearing of Chriſt, which is the ſumm of all a Chriſtians Hopes; and thoſe Hopes the great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>When we ſo eſteem it and look upon it with ſuch a regard, as it is preſented to us in the glaſs of Gods Word; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately we ſhall feel our hearts begin to draw towards it. This is the firſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a devout Chriſtian, who would <hi>love</hi> the appearing of his Saviour, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his heart to have a reſpect to it, far above all other things. That bleſſed day, all pious hearts who have any hope of his favour, ſhould think of and look for as the brighteſt that ever ſhone. The Coronation of a King, the Triumph of a Conquerour, the publick applauſe in the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, the moſt famous Showes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50236:47"/>that have ever been, or can be made, are all (they muſt remember) but as ſo many little Puppet-plays, in compariſon with that grand ſpectacle. When all the world ſhall be in a gaze, when Angels as well as men ſhall wonder and admire; when the Sun ſhall bluſh to ſee it ſelf out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhone and overcome in brightneſs; when the hoſts of bleſſed Spirits ſhall be the only Stars, and our great Lord the only Sun that appears in the firmament; when the righteous themſelves ſhall ſhine in the ſame ſplendor, by the reflection of his rayes upon them.</p>
                  <p>Thus we muſt diſcourſe with our ſelves continually, if we would be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of our happineſs (as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>

O poor world! How come I ſo far to value thee, as to ſuffer thee to captivate this heart? How glad ſhould I rather be to ſee thee no more; if I might but behold him, whom my ſoul loveth, appear? Nay, it ought not to grieve me to ſee this earth, and all things in it in a flame; if that coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial glory would but ſhow it ſelf.

                     <hi>Come my Friends and my Relations (the deareſt goods in this world) let us ſet our hearts on this; and deſire to meet together with our Lord.

                  <p>But hitherto we have only laid the foundation of <hi>Love.</hi> Which ſuppoſes moreover, that we have ſome ſympathy (as I may call it) with that which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to be ſo <hi>Good</hi> for us; and that we take our ſelves to be very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it. For there are ſome things that are excellent in themſelves; to which notwithſtanding we find little or no inclination; becauſe they are not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to our diſpoſitions, neceſſities and deſires. The greateſt Perfections and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits oftimes meet with more Admirers than they do Vaſſals: and we ſee thoſe every day who bow other hearts to their ſervice, but find us inflexible to their attractions. As we have not an appetite to all ſorts of meats, even thoſe which we judge to be wholeſome and good; ſo we have not an inclination to all perſons and things, even thoſe which we hold to be well deſerving. We praiſe many things
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50236:49"/>which we do not love. We allow divers objects our approbation, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not much affect. And that which in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we needs muſt commend, yet doth not always command our hearts, and draw them to its embraces.</p>
                  <p>The Loadſtone, as is commonly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which draws Iron to it, finds Lead and Copper to have no perception of its touches: and that face, as I ſaid before, which bewitches ſome eyes, leaves others inſenſible of its beauty.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Love</hi> then which we contract with any Good, ariſes from the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is between us and it. We per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an agreeableneſs in it, either to our needs or to our nature, and thence affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſprings. The likeneſs and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance that there is between two beings, is not the only cauſe of their readineſs to embrace each the other: but the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence alſo and proportion which the one bears to the others neceſſities, is a ſufficient ground of it. A man that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes under a dangerous ſickneſs, may conceive a great affection for an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable and very compaſſionate Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, though there be no ſimilitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; becauſe he apprehends
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50236:49"/>that ſufficiency in him, which is able to ſupply the great defects and wants that are at preſent in himſelf. But when theſe two, <hi>correſpondence</hi> and <hi>ſimilitude</hi> (which ſeveral have ſuch power over the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) ſhall both meet together in one thing; ſo that what we want is that to which by nature we incline; it cannot fail to produce a love exceeding all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in intire union, ardency and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity. For how can we refuſe to yield to that Good (or what would we have more than that) which our hearts feel at once, to bear a great reſemblance to them, and to anſwer all or moſt of their needs? a Good which is what we are, and what we would be too: a Good wherein we ſee the image of our ſelves, in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to which we deſire to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced?</p>
                  <p>All they therefore who would be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed to love the appearing of our Lord, muſt have a deep apprehenſion of the meanneſs and vileneſs of this preſent ſtate. They muſt be poſſeſſed with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſenſe of their many imperfections, and great weakneſs in the beſt condition that this world affords; of the poverty and emptineſs of all earthly enjoyments;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50236:50"/>yea, and of the ſcantineſs and narrowneſs of all thoſe Divine participations which their Souls are here capable to be bleſſed withal. And then the Appearing of our Lord will ſeem a Good ſo ſuitable to them, that they cannot chuſe but have the ſame affection for it, that a crazy and diſeaſed perſon hath to the moſt skilful Phyſician. In hope that He will perfect their nature, cure the diſorders under which they labour, ſupply their defects, fill their appetites, nay enlarge their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, and raiſe them to a greater pitch of true goodneſs and bliſs.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſuppoſe ſuch perſons to be ſo much in the favour of God as to have a liberal ſhare even in the bleſſings of this World, as well as of thoſe which are more peculiarly in the gift of our Saviour Chriſt: yet it is impoſſible, one would think, they ſhould be ſo much pleaſed in the higheſt Dignities that can be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on them; in the rareſt Delicates that the bounty of Nature, or curioſity of Art can provide for them; in the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the choiceſt and deareſt Friends; or (I may add) in their own ſecret joy, though deſcending from heaven to them; as not to think ſtill that it is far more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50236:50"/>to ſee the Lord Jeſus come to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote them and all their pious Relations and Friends to an incomparably better condition in his Coeleſtial Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>It is their intereſt to have Him appear again; and beſides, they have ſuch a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reſemblance to Him, that the bent and inclination of their Souls cannot but make them long after the ſight of Him, as a good more delightful and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable than any other. For there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Coming of Chriſt, before that which we expect, <hi>Quo per totum tempus in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia ſua venit, &amp;c.</hi> (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks
<note n="*" place="margin">L. xx. de Civ. Dei, Cap. v.</note>) by which He comes, through all the time between his firſt appearing and the laſt, in His Church; that is his members, <hi>particulatim atque paulatim,</hi> working in every one of them by little and little; according to his promiſe, xiv. <hi>Joh.</hi> 21, 23. that if any man keep His Commandments, He will look upon it as ſuch a teſtimony of his love, that He will love that man, and the Father will love him; <hi>and we will come</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> Now when we hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily entertain Him, and He is ſo truly ſetled there, that we are made partakers of his Bleſſed nature and diſpoſition, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50236:51"/>all the lineaments of Him (if I may ſo ſpeak) are drawn upon our hearts: We ſhall find them inclined to wiſh for the day, when he will compleat his work, and fill up the whole image of Himſelf, to the very life; and not only make us glad with the light of His countenance, but make us look perfectly like Him, and intirely aſſimilate us to His own moſt Bleſſed nature.</p>
                  <p>Do you not ſee how the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures repreſent this Appearing of Jeſus as the moſt lovely of all other things; and therefore apt to draw our hearts with an irreſiſtible force towards it? It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed there, I obſerve, under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of that which is wont to touch the Soul with ſuch an agreeable ſtroke, that it raviſhes it from it ſelf; I mean Beauty. For as that is nothing elſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Plato,</hi> but the ſplendor and glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of that which is good; ſo this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing is ſet forth as exceeding bright, ſplendid and glorious, and as that which will make us ſo alſo: to the end we may be affected with it, as the moſt beautiful ſight that ever was. Read ij. <hi>Tit.</hi> 13. xiij. <hi>Mat.</hi> 43. And St. <hi>Luke,</hi> I told you before, mentions a threefold glory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50236:51"/>He will appear, <hi>His own, His Fathers, and His holy Angels,</hi> ix. 26. which is ſaid, I believe, to make this day appear the more illuſtrious and amiable in our eyes.</p>
                  <p>The only viſage of <hi>Scipio,</hi> we read, made him Maſter of ſome barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he piercing further into their hearts by his countenance, than by his ſword. And <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> as bad as he was, was no ſooner ſhown by his Mother to the Souldiers, but, from Prieſt of the <hi>Sun</hi> he became Emperour of the World. Why then ſhould not the beauty of that day, when the Prince of all the Kings of the Earth ſhall appear in the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſplendor, attended by the greateſt Principalities of Heaven, with all their ſhining Hoſts, in admirable order, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the hearts of all thoſe that love Him, ſince there is none ſo powerful, did they but <hi>behold His glory</hi> (as the Apoſtles did) and look upon Him <hi>as the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth,</hi> to draw thoſe to his Religion who love Him not? How can they refuſe to yield to do Him homage, and ſuffer themſelves to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried after Him as the Conquerour of all Souls; and above all deſire to wait upon
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50236:52"/>Him at his appearing; which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern will be ſo glorious and render them ſo amiable, that they will become (as I doubt not to ſhow) a conſiderable addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Triumphs?</p>
                  <p>The hearts of all the faithful cannot chuſe but leap for joy, at the very thought of ſo great a Good, though widely diſtant from them; and wiſh it would come nearer to make them happy by its preſence with them. They are apt to ſigh and ſay, when they deeply ponder theſe things, with the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> in another caſe, ci. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O when wilt thou come unto me! It is a long time, O Lord, ſince thou didſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to come. We have waited for thee and for thy ſalvation, more than they that wait for the morning; I ſay, more than they that wait for the morning. May I not pray thee to haſten thy deſired coming? O when wilt thou diſplay thy ſelf, and ſhow thy glory more openly before us? O when wilt thou be pleaſed to impreſs thine own image more fairly on us? When ſhall thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle touches that we have received of thee, be perfected, and figured into a more exact reſemblance of thy beauty?</hi>

                     <hi>We cannot refrain, but we muſt long to have all our defects ſupplied out of thy fulneſs; to have all ſpots wiped off our ſouls, to be rendred clear as the Sun, free as the Air, and as unſtained as the pure influences of heaven. For how ſhould we think, O bleſſed Lord, that we bear any love to thee, if we can be content to remain (as we are) ſo much unlike thee? There is none can ſee thee, and not ardently love thee. There is none ever beheld thy face, that was not impatient to be conformed to thee. None have taſted thy ſweetneſs, who could be ſatisfied till they came to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of it.</hi>

Yea, ſuffer us to ask when thou wilt come and give us all, that ſo we may ask no more of thee. O how joyful will that time be, which ſhall make us ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, that all our buſineſs will be to praiſe and thank thee! How comfortable will thy appearing be, which ſhall make us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with thee?</hi>

                  <p>NOW when we feel our ſouls thus touched with any thing that ſeems very good and convenient for us; the firſt approaches of it beget a complacence in the heart, and give it a ſenſe of no ſmall joy and pleaſure. For when the Image, you may obſerve, of any good that imprinted it ſelf, is on the mind or imagination, it inſtantly endeavours to proceed further, and creeps into the heart, the will and affections; which cannot but turn themſelves towards it, to feel what this is which ſhows ſo fairly, and comes ſo kindly to ſalute them. Now when the heart thus looks about to ſee what it is that courts it; you ſhall find, if you mark it, that at the very firſt greeting it is entertained with a certain
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50236:53"/>delight and pleaſure; which this new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gueſt brings along with it, to invite us to it.</p>
                  <p>For if you examine things ſtrictly, and with ſuch a curious eye, as ſome have done; you will perceive that this Image which imprints it ſelf upon us, is of the ſame nature with light or any ſhining body. It caſts, as I may ſay, its bright rays round about the ſoul; it diſperſes it ſelf, by a kind of illumination, into the will and affections, that they may be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how amiable it is: Which when they are, the Light is not more pleaſant to the eyes, than this is to the heart. It rejoyces in this good which preſents it ſelf to its enjoyment, as a man doth in the welcome approach of an ancient Friend; whom he is glad to ſee, but much more glad to feel in his arms.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch is the contentment that the belief of Chriſts appearing gives to all thoſe who fix their thoughts upon it. It chears and refreſhes their ſpirits. It ſmooths their minds, and makes them ſo calm and ſtill, that the <hi>Halcyon</hi> days are but fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſhadows of that reſt and peace which then they feel in themſelves. Their heart is intirely delighted and ſatisfied with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50236:54"/>this belief. It is ſo tranſported beyond it ſelf with this comfortable perſwaſion, that it can eaſily overlook all other joys, when it lifts up it ſelf in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this incomparable bleſſedneſs. No muſick can then be ſo ſweet to the ear, as the ſound of the trump of God. No beauty ſo fair to the eye, as that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which ſhall be reveal'd. No company ſo inviting and welcome to the heart, as that great Aſſembly of Chriſt, with all his holy Angels.</p>
                  <p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50236:54"/>to call us up to himſelf? Shall we ſee Him who loves us ſo much, and be transformed at the ſight of Him? O wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come news! When didſt thou meet with any tidings like to this? which ſheds ſuch a ſudden and tranſcendent joy and gladneſs abroad in thy heart, and prevents my forward thoughts, which were going to exhort thee to rejoyce? What hadst thou loſt, if thou hadſt turned away thine eyes from this bliſsful ſight? How great an happineſs hadst thou been deprived of, if thine heart had not opened, when the report of His coming knockt at its door?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But, O my ſoul, how ſweet then will this appearing it ſelf be, the hope of which is ſo delicious? How will that ſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance us, the news of which at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is ſo comfortable to us? Into what raptures will it caſt us, which now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires ſuch joy into our hearts? What a bright day will that be, which through all the clouds wherein we are wrapt, ſpreads round about us ſuch a cheerful light? If the repreſentation of our Lord in the holy Sacrament of His body and blood, and that but in His ſufferings and low eſtate, give ſuch ſatisfaction to the heart; What will the ſight of Himſelf
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50236:55"/>do to us, and that when he appears in his glorious Majeſty, as the Lord of Heaven and Earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O ſweet Jeſus, come, and let us ſee what that Majeſty and Glory is! come and draw aſide the veil, do away the ſhadows, and preſent thy ſelf as the King of Glory before our eyes. They have long looked for thee. They would gladly know what it is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thee in thy glory. O how gladly would they underſtand what the meaning is of</hi> thy coming in the Clouds of Heaven? <hi>The brightneſs of them, we believe, is infinitely beyond all that eye ever ſaw. The thoughts of it revive our hearts, and make our faces ſhine. Our ſouls are drawn out, and run to meet thee, by the joy we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at the promiſe of thy coming. Though we have not ſeen thee, yet we love thee; and though we now ſee thee not,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. i. 8.</note> yet belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> we rejoyce <hi>(O that we could ſay)</hi> with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O bleſſed Lord, do not deny to compleat our joys, by haſtning thy coming to let us ſee thee. Come and fill our eyes, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not here be ſatisfied with ſeeing. Come and ſhew us thy glory; that we may ſay,</hi> it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth. <hi>And let our hearts, in the mean time, rejoyce in nothing ſo much, as in the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50236:55"/>hope of thy glory. Let them always prefer this above their chiefeſt joy; and never wiſh for any thing with ſo much fervour, as for thy coming.</hi>

                  <p>Now from this pleaſant ſenſe which is excited in us by the appearance of any Good to us, there naturally follows, not only a deſire but, a vehement motion, and as it were an effuſion of the heart, towards that which is ſo agreeable, and promiſes it ſo much ſatisfaction. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence, you muſt know, is but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of love. For by that delicious pleaſure which the heart feels, when any good approaches, it is invited further; and even forced to pour forth it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that fair thing which preſents it ſelf ſo ſweetly to it; and this is properly Love.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as ever we diſcover any thing that is ſuitable to us, we feel our hearts inſtantly ſtruck with a ſecret joy, and are marvellouſly delighted in it. And this delectable touch is no ſooner percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but it ſweetly, yet ſtrongly draws us to go towards that thing, which at firſt ſight gave us ſuch a pleaſure; and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50236:56"/>will yield, we hope, a far greater, when we approach ſo near it, as to get poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it. Complacence or delight then, is but the firſt ſtirring or motion, which a good thing cauſes in our heart. This pleaſing motion and agitation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is attended preſently with a melting and as it were effuſion of the heart; whereby we run out to meet that belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved object, and entertain it into our ſouls; and in this, as I ſaid, properly conſiſts the very being of Love. Which is ſo manifeſt in an heart duly affected towards the appearing of our bleſſed Lord; that there cannot be a greater proof of the truth of this deſcription. For it feels ſo great a pleaſure in the lively belief of his coming, that it is drawn thereby quite out of it ſelf; and cannot chuſe but reſign up it ſelf intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that glorious Prince, that He may make it appear together with Him. It eaſily diſſolves in that heavenly warmth, and loſing all its power to contain it ſelf in its former bounds, flows to Him the Lord of Life, as to its proper place. It is lifted up towards heaven, and would fain be there where He is, from whom this pleaſure comes. For with Him is the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50236:56"/>fountain of Life; and therefore where ſhould a devout ſoul ſet <hi>its affections but on thoſe things which are above,</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 3 <hi>Col.</hi> i. 3, 4.) where Chriſt <hi>ſitteth at the right hand of God?</hi> Which when they mightily affect the heart, it feels as if it were diſſolving, into that <hi>life which is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That future life or bliſs is <hi>ſafe</hi> indeed, becauſe it is in the cuſtody of Chriſt, and in a glorious place where God dwells in light inacceſſible. But who can abſtain from deſiring, it ſhould be no longer <hi>hid</hi> and reſerved, but made manifeſt and ſhown, as it will be at the appearing of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> For ſo the Apoſtle adds imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately (as if He would anſwer their Queſtion who might ask when ſhall this <hi>Life</hi> be diſcovered?) <hi>When Chriſt who is our Life</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the cauſe of it, who will give us this life) <hi>ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with Him in glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O what a joyful word is this! what ſhould hinder an heart, that is poſſeſſed with a full belief of it, from running thither with all ſpeed; whither it is called by ſo great a joy, as ſent from thence into it? Into whoſe arms ſhould it leap but only His, the expectation of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50236:57"/>whoſe appearing creates that exultation? There is none in heaven it can deſire but Him, with whom its life is hid; and whom is there on earth that it can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire beſides Him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Come,</hi> ſaith ſuch a ſoul to it ſelf, <hi>and lift up thy head: Thy Lord I hear is coming; let us ariſe and go and meet Him. Let us leave this earth, and aſcend up towards heaven; where He is, who is our Life. Let us raiſe up our dull thoughts thitherward; and fix our minds as oft as we can, on the glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us ſtir up our ſelves, and with the moſt ardent deſires and affections of our heart, get as near Him as ever we are able. let us go, O my Soul, and at leaſt make a preſent of our very heart to Him; beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Him moſt earneſtly to poſſeſs Himſelf intirely of it.

Thou hast loved me, and given thy ſelf for me: O love me ſo much (I again beſeech thee) as to live in me. I would begin that life which is hid with thee, in reſigning my ſelf to thee, that thy will may be done in me. Never did I feel ſuch complacence in following mine own, as I have ſince I was inclined to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after thee; who wilt lead me, I ſee, to immortal glory.</hi>

What can I wiſh for more than to be bleſſed with the ſight of it; and till it come, to have my heart always in love with it?

                  <p>AND yet this <hi>Love</hi> cannot content it ſelf with inward motions and aſpirations of the Soul towards the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of our Lord; but conſtantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites all ſuch actions as are requiſite for the attaining of ſo great a Good. If we eſteem any thing highly, and feel it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding agreeable to our hearts deſire, we do not willingly reſt in the pleaſing paſſions it raiſes up in our hearts; but they carry us out in earneſt endeavours to be owners of it. And the influence it hath upon us is ſo powerful, and it doth ſo ſtrongly draw us after it; that it will not ſuffer any thing to put a ſtop to the current of our affections, when they are iſſuing out unto it.</p>
                  <p>There are certain imperfect motions in our hearts, which we are apt to call
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50236:59"/>Love, that by no means deſerve that name; being only a good liking of that, which we do not yet truly love. They are called in the Schools, <hi>Velleities,</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes and wouldings, as we ſpeak; half a will which we feel for divers excellent things, but never come to any effect. The reaſon is, becauſe the appearance of ſome extream great difficulty, or the force of ſome contrary deſire, either holds the ſoul in her courſe (as ſhe is moving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them) and beats her affections back again; or elſe turns the ſtream of them quite another way.</p>
                  <p>Love therefore is a generous vigour in the heart, which incites and ſtrengthens it to fair and noble actions, for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting its deſires; though oppoſed by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many enemies. It is called by ſome the fire wherewith the ſoul is clothed, which forces its way through all reſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. A certain ardor in us, which inſpires us to worthy though difficult underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. An Heroick paſſion, which makes us think nothing impoſſible, that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be done, for the compaſſing the end at which it aims.</p>
                  <p>Thus then muſt our ſouls be carried, with ſuch ſtrong affections, towards the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50236:59"/>appearing of Chriſt, if we heartily love it. We muſt omit nothing that we know is required of us, for the obtaining the bleſſings which it will bring unto us. We muſt bid all things ſtand aſide that would impede us; and tell them they muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to no intereſt at all in us, when we are in purſuit of ſo great a good. The love of which will ſoon reconcile us to the hardeſt duties; and endear to us the moſt ſelf-denying courſes. It will alter the countenance of ſufferings, and make all the troubles of this life caſt a kinder aſpect on us. Nay, it will enable us to look death in the face with a cheerful heart. For it will preſent it to us in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhape; and make the Grave, that houſe of darkneſs, ſeem like the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful gate of the Temple of God.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever our Lord declares to be his pleaſure, this will bid us do it; though we be undone by that means in all our temporal concerns. And when they tempt us to murmur and repine, to cry and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at our parting with them: Love will bid us be of good comfort; becauſe this is the way to have a fair reception by our Lord, when He ſhall ſee we have quitted all for His ſake. We cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50236:60"/>keep them always if we would; yet ſuch is his love, our faith tells us, that if we conſent to forſake them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand upon his account, He will not ſuffer us to be loſers by it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our love both to Him and to our ſelves, prompts us not to ſtick at any thing which will be pleaſing to Him, though for the preſent it be harſh to us. It teaches us to reaſon as St. <hi>Peter</hi> doth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> iij. 11, 12. <hi>Seeing all theſe things must be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs; Looking for and haſting unto the coming of the day of the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What manner of perſons?</hi> Truly, ſuch as are preparing a room in their hearts for their Lord. Such as hope then to compleat their Eſpouſals to Chriſt. And therefore muſt <hi>be holy and without blame before Him in love,</hi> (1. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.) and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nothing ſo much as to be found ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in his ſight (who is the Lord of their hearts, and their very life); and to be nobly entertained by Him, when He ſhall come again to receive His loving ſubjects up unto Himſelf. <hi>We have our converſation in heaven</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>from whence we expect the Saviour, the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50236:60"/>Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to His glorious body, according to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whereby He can ſubdue all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Himſelf.</hi> For in all reaſon they that expect ſuch a ſight ſhould fit themſelves for it by a converſation ſuitable to the dignity to which they ſhall be then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. So <hi>Oecumenius</hi> I remember ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds theſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> when he anſwers the Queſtion, <hi>who is it that loves his appearing,</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Which if we love, it will not fail to raiſe us unto a heavenly life. If we wait for Him to come from Heaven, it will lift up our hearts, and carry them thither. We ſhall disburden them of all carnal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and throw off the load of the cares of this world, that we may be light and airy, ready to fly up above, when He calls us, to be with Him. We ſhall labour to cleanſe and purifie our ſouls as He is pure; to adorn them with His Graces; and, in one word, <hi>to put on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> that He may ſee Himſelf in us, when He comes.</p>

                  <p>But true love cannot ſtay here nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nor content it ſelf with ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to enjoy that Good, which propounds it ſelf to its affections; for it ever tends to an <hi>

No ſooner doth any thing appear beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and lovely to the mind or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but preſently the heart ſends meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers (as I may call the ſpirits that iſſue out of it) to bring it home, and conduct it to take up its lodging there. This is the meaning of that effuſion of the Soul which I ſpoke of before; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it would diſſolve it ſelf into that which it loves, and be ſo mingled as to become perfectly one with it.</p>
                  <p>When an agreeable object, I told you, hath imprinted its image on the mind, it caſts a certain light into the ſoul, and ſhines ſo comfortably on the affections, that they are powerfully warmed and excited by it. Now when the heart is full of this ſplendor, it doth not ſatisfie it ſelf with thoſe rays and emiſſions of light and heat, which are imparted to it; but ſtrives to unite it ſelf to the very center of it, and would feel the ſpring from whence ſuch life and pleaſure flows.</p>
                  <p>Juſt as Iron when it is impregnated with the vertue of the Loadſtone, is not
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50236:62"/>contented with thoſe effluxes it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but moves towards the body from which they ſtream; ſo is it with an heart which receives this joyful news from our Lord, that He will appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in glory. It amuſes not it ſelf in thoſe delightful thoughts; it ſits not down in thoſe raviſhing joys; nor thinks it enough to be melted in the paſſion of love to Him, and to ſo great a bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But it ſeeks to knit it ſelf to the very mind and ſpirit of Chriſt, that it may feel how bleſſed He intends to make it. It ſtudies, I mean, to be changed and transformed more and more into His likeneſs; and by an intire agreement of will with his will, to begin its transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and be prepared for a perfect and eternal union with Him.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſufficient to a heart that is in love with that great day, to live in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant expectation of it (which is excited by the Revelation He hath made of it in his Goſpel, and is the light which he now ſends from heaven into us:) but it would gladly prevent, as I have already noted, that happy time; by feeling Him appear every day more gloriouſly there. It longs to ſhine more clearly in the light of his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50236:63"/>heavenly knowledge; to burn more brightly in the ardors of his love; and by being more richly adorned with the Graces of His Spirit, to be recommended to all in the beauty of His Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing can better explain all that hath been hitherto ſaid, than the example of the Loadſtone, which I juſt now mentioned. As ſoon as a piece of Iron feels the power of it, we ſee how it turns it ſelf towards it; and by its qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering declares the complacence and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (as we may call it) that it takes in its touches. Then we behold how it creeps a little towards it; ſtill advancing and bearing it ſelf more and more that way, till it come to join it ſelf with that thing, from whence it firſt received thoſe inclinations. Here you have all the parts of love, that have been already mentioned, moſt lively repreſented. Firſt, the mind apprehends, and is made ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſome Good, which communicates an image or picture of it ſelf unto it. Then the heart is ſecretly ſurpriſed with a certain delight, by which the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of that image intices it from its ſelf. And then it moves towards it, and goes to ſee it. And at laſt, when it finds
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50236:63"/>it to be what it appeared, it flies, as I may ſay, into its embraces, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to knit it ſelf ſo faſt unto it, that they may never hereafter be divided.</p>
                  <p>And juſt ſuch like is the temper of that ſoul, which heartily loves our Lords Appearing. Which it perceives to be a happineſs ſo great, that it cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with any entertainment it finds in this world, but preſſes forward to the bleſſed ſight of Him in all his glory. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can quiet it, nor hinder its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till it become one ſpirit with Him. All that it hath as yet attained, all the wiſdom wherewith it is filled, all the joys of piety which it ſometime feels, are little and inconſiderable in compariſon with what it deſires to feel. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on it proceeds in a ſerious ſtudy to be more like Him; out of a deſign never to ceaſe its earneſt endeavours, till it come to be for ever with Him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O thou great and moſt Magnetick Good</hi> (ſhould every pious heart ſay) <hi>O thon ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign attractive of all ſouls; I feel my ſelf wonderfully touched by thee. Thou haſt put my ſpirit, which was fooliſhly wandring
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50236:64"/>after other things, in a ſetled motion unto thee. O what an inclination haſt thou awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in my heart, to be with thee! Thou haſt mightily ſtirred all the powers of my ſoul, which is wholly turned about, to look moſt earneſtly towards thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O ceaſe not to ſhine perpetually into this cloudy mind, which is all in darkneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee. Ceaſe not to invigorate this dull and ſluggiſh ſpirit, which is thus excited by thee. O ſpare not thoſe mighty effluxes of thy love; but draw me ſtill after thee. I cannot be willing to ſtand at any diſtance from thee; nor to ſtop my progreſs till I be cloſely united to thee. Therefore ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to make me feel thy power, till I be ſo happy as to move no more, but to reſt in thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Couldſt not thou be pleaſed, O bleſſed Lord, with any thing leſs than an union with ſuch ſinful fleſh, as this of ours is? would it not ſuffice thee to look down from heaven upon us, and ſhow us a glympſe of thy glory; but thou muſt come alſo and dwell among us; and make thy ſelf to be bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh, that we might be one with thee? How can I be contented then, only with looking up unto thee? How ſhould I be ſatisfied if I have
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50236:64"/>nothing more, but meerly ſome glances from thee? O my moſt gracious Lord, give me leave to imitate thy love. Suffer me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and ſeek to become what thou art, by being perfectly transformed into thy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And do not think it too great a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, if I wiſh and long to be ſo united to thee, My Love, as to be for ever with thee.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Let me have the happineſs at leaſt to ſigh and mourn after thine Appearing. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect my heart ſo ſenſibly with it, that I may groan in ſpirit (if I can do no better) for that bleſſed time, when I ſhall loſe the ſight of thy face no more, when I ſhall lye under the warm beams of the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; when I ſhall live in the very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of love; when I ſhall be ſo near thee, that I ſhall feel my ſelf to move in the very ſame Orb with thee, thou bright Sun of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſeem now alas! to be a great way off from thee. I feel my ſelf like the cold earth, in the winter; which turns towards the Sun, and looks upon that glorious Light of Heaven, that great lover of all the world, but alas! is very far removed from its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable rays. O that I might be ſo happy as to approach nearer to thee! O that I
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50236:65"/>were fixed, and might never turn about any more from thee! Let the time come, that there ſhall be no more night, but a perpetual day with me. O haſten the time, when I my ſelf ſhall ſhine like the Sun, in thy Celeſtial glory.</hi>

                  <p>Now in the mean time, till love come to a perfect union, as it is inceſſant in its motion, ſo it grows more vehement in its deſires and endeavours. For as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent agitations make the fire burn more fiercely, ſo doth the ſtirring of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion make it break out with a brighter flame. The deſire of union increaſes the ſwiftneſs of its motion; and the more ſpeed it makes, the nearer it is like to come to its deſired union. And, which is very conſiderable, the more earneſt and aſſiduous our motion is towards any Good, the greater hopes we have that we ſhall enjoy it; and the greater our hopes are, the more are we ſtill pricked on and ſpurred forward in the purſuit of that which we would fain enjoy.</p>
                  <p>A thing which is of exceeding great moment in this pious and devout love of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50236:65"/>Chriſtian people. For without a <hi>GOOD HOPE</hi> (which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, our Lord, <hi>who is our Hope,</hi> hath given us, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ii. 16. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 1.) our motion would ſlacken, if not be extinguiſhed. We ſhould have no heart to proſecute our deſign, but let it fall immediately; if it were not <hi>in hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lye hath promiſed,</hi> i. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. As on the contrary by the help of this ſure and certain Hope, our diligence is doubled; and ſuch oyl poured on our wheels, as makes them move not only more eaſily, but with greater ſpeed and quickneſs alſo.</p>
                  <p>All the lovers therefore of Chriſts Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, are ſaid to <hi>wait</hi> for it, to <hi>expect</hi> it, and to <hi>look</hi> for the coming of <hi>that bleſſed Hope,</hi> as you ſhall ſee in the concluſion of this Argument, from thoſe well known places, iij. <hi>Phil.</hi> 20. ij. <hi>Tit.</hi> 13. and many other. And if you exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the holy Scriptures carefully, you ſhall find that this is comprehended in the <hi>love</hi> we ought to have for his Appearing; being ſuch a natural effect of love, that they are put indifferently the one for the other. As may be ſeen by comparing theſe two places together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ij. 9.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50236:66"/>with lxiv. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. in the former of which the Apoſtle ſays, the things which ſurpaſs our conception, are prepared by God <hi>for them that love him;</hi> and in the other the Prophet ſaith, He hath prepared them <hi>for him that waiteth for Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Juſt as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> praying without the Sanctuary (in the Court to which they were confined) waited for the Prieſt when he ſhould come from the Altar of Incenſe, or rather for the High-Prieſt on the day of Atonement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the moſt holy place and the Ark of the Covenant, to beſtow the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on them: So do all good Souls, who are devoted ſincerely to the ſervice of Chriſt, while they remain in this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court, (the Earth wherein we dwell, which is at a great diſtance from the Heavens) look up to the holy place, where <hi>Jeſus the great High-Prieſt of our profeſſion is;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">iij. Heb. 1. &amp; iv. 15.</note> and wait for the time when He will come forth to bleſs them, ſaying, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father,

                  </p>
                  <p>They cannot but frequently caſt their eyes and turn their hearts that way, as the place of their Reſt, which He is gone
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50236:66"/>before to prepare for them. They are ever calling upon their Souls to <hi>follow hard</hi> after their dear Saviour, as <hi>David</hi> ſays (lxiij. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.) his heart did after the enjoyment of God in his Sanctuary. For this they ſeek, as he there ſpeaks, with thirſty deſires, <hi>to ſee his power and his glory,</hi> ſo as they have never yet ſeen him, nor can ſee him; no not in their neareſt approaches to him, while they live in theſe earthly tabernacles. They wiſh therefore He would come and bleſs them with a clear and full ſight of Him. After this their deſires grow daily more ardent; and they endeavour to ſtir up ſtronger and more affectionate motions towards ſo great an happineſs. They are apt to cry out, ſaying, <hi>Draw us, and we will run after thee;</hi> yea, we will fly; we will take the wings of an Eagle (in our paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate deſires) that we may mount up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, and get more and more above this world to be with thee.</p>
                  <p>And this gives them good Hopes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that they ſhall be with Him; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they cannnot but ſay:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O bleſſed Jeſus, thou haſt ſet our Souls into a longing for thee; and now they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Thou haſt made us believe the moſt excellent ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing glory, wherein thou ſhineſt; and ever ſince we cannot chuſe but look towards it, and wiſh to behold thee in that glory. If we be very earneſt for this ſight, if our Souls ſigh and ſay,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And may we not hope to come thither where thou art, when thou thy ſelf attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est our ſouls to thee? Wilt thou not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe longings, which not we, but thou haſt raiſed in our hearts? Give us leave to remember thee of what thou thy ſelf haſt ſaid, who didſt pronounce thoſe BLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SED WHO HAVE NOT SEEN,
<note place="margin">xx. Joh. 29.</note> AND YET HAVE BELIEVED. O let it be unto thy ſervants according to thy word. For we are ſuch believers, as thou haſt bleſſed. We never ſaw thee, and yet believe</hi> thou cameſt forth from God,
<note place="margin">xiij. Joh. 3.</note> and art gone to God; <hi>and art moſt high in the glory of the Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ix. Rom. 5.</note> God bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. <hi>Do not our hearts cleave unto thee, though they have only heard of thee? Are not our eyes continually towards thee, though they have never yet beheld thee?
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50236:67"/>Thou wilt not always ſure abſent thy ſelf; but turn our faith at laſt into a ſight of thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For what is the BLESSEDNESS of which thou ſpakeſt, and haſt faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſuch believers? Is it not that they ſhall one day behold thy glorious face, and reign with thee in thy glory? Is it not that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf unto them here; and at last appear again to take them to thy ſelf, that they may live where thou art? O dear Saviour, as thou haſt made us to BELIEVE in this manner; ſo make us likewiſe thus BLESSED. As we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thee, though we have not ſeen thee; ſo let this be the reward of our receiving thee, that we may ſee thee. We will hope thou wilt make us thus happy; as thou haſt made us thus faithful. We will expect till thou makest us ſee what thou haſt promiſed, as thou haſt made us do what thou haſt commanded.

                  <p>AND now can any Soul chuſe but think of that perpetually, which it moſt dearly loves? Doth not every Good uſe to preſent it ſelf continually to the mind that is inamour'd of it, and remember us of its beauty? There is no queſtion to be made of it. The very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of our affection for it, doth more imprint and engrave it on our mind; and when, by any participation of it, we feel how good it is, we preſs it harder, and ſink it deeper into our hearts. There is no man, for inſtance, who hath ſetled his love upon an agreeable perſon, but He finds the image of that friend always before his eyes. It accompanies him eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and cleaves inſeparably to his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50236:68"/>thoughts. It is a great part of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to entertain himſelf with the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of that in which he hath lodg'd his heart.</p>
                  <p>And therefore if we love the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord, we ſhall ſolace our ſelves often with the kind. <hi>In the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> eſpecially or tumult <hi>of our thoughts within us</hi> (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks xciv. 19.) <hi>the comforts of it will delight our ſouls.</hi> We ſhall be daily calling upon them, and exhorting them to look towards it; and to fix their thoughts and affections upon it. We ſhall be inclin'd to ſay, as the voice is in the Song of Songs, <hi>Come my fair one, come away.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>O my chiefeſt Good, what ſhall I deſire or wiſh for ſo much, as for thy coming? What is it that I ever ſaw, which ſhould detain my eyes from thy incomparable beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Or where can I expect to ſatisfie their hunger, but only with the filling ſight of thee, at thy appearing? The ſpacious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens hope to be filled with the Majeſty of thy Glory. The Sun is but a weak image of thy brightneſs, and will be content to go out to make room for thee when thou appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50236:69"/>All the Stars of light are ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign their places, and leave the skie to be illuminated by thee alone. Whatſoever is lovely and ſurpriſes us with its beauty here, confeſſes it is but thy ſhadow, and that when thou breakeſt forth it muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fix my mind therefore upon thy glory; and let it henceforth imploy my buſie thoughts. Poſſeſs thy ſelf, O Lord of life and glory, intirely of this heart, which hath been too long eſtranged from thee.

When I meet with my deareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Friends, let nothing entertain us with ſuch delight, as to think of being</hi> caught up together in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us love to</hi> ſpeak of the glory of thy Kingdom, and to talk of thy power: to utter abundantly the memory of thy great goodneſs, and to ſing of thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. <hi>Let us wiſh with united hearts</hi> to ſee thy power and glory; <hi>and to behold thee coming, according to thy faithful promiſe,

                  <p>Theſe are ſome of the pantings of an heart, which loves and bears in mind the appearing of Chriſt. For to ſay the truth, Love is the original and ſource of all the paſſions that we feel in our hearts. They all flow from this as from their ſpring-head. They are but ſeveral moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have their riſe from Love. Or, if you will ſo conceive it, nothing but different figures and ſhapes wherein it appears. It is love which fears, and love which grieves, and love which hopes, and love which rejoyces: there would be none of theſe, were it not for ſome good which we love; to which theſe and all the reſt of their kindred, owe their birth and nouriſhment. When this is hindred in its deſignes, it breeds an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or impatience, or fear, or ſadneſs, or ſome ſuch like commotion: And
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50236:70"/>when this ſucceeds and proſpers in the purſuance of its ends; there ariſes hope, and contentment, and joy and gladneſs, as the natural iſſue of it.</p>
                  <p>They that love then Chriſts appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will fear nothing ſo much as to loſe the bleſſedneſs which He will bring along with Him. Nothing will excite ſuch a diſpleaſure in their hearts, as that evil which would rob and defraud them of his favour at that happy day. And what is there that can give them ſuch a touch of ſadneſs, as the thought that they are ſo far diſtant from their Deareſt Lord? Or what can create ſuch joy, ſuch exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſpirit, as to hope they ſhall one day ſee Him, ſo as never to part from Him any more? In one word, all the paſſions of their Souls will run this way, and be concern'd for nothing ſo highly as this, that they may be <hi>preſented fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs before the preſence of his glory with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joy.</hi>

                     <hi>True indeed, O bleſſed Saviour,</hi> (doth ſuch an heart meditate in it ſelf) <hi>I have had a thouſand fears in my breaſt. I have dreaded every ſmall danger in this world,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50236:70"/>as if it would prove my utter ruin. The terrors that have affrighted me, are as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable as the things I have fancied to be my happineſs. But now all theſe are willing to be gone, that they may make way for one greater fear; leſt I ſhould not enter with thee, when thou appeareſt, into thy reſt. O prevent ſo intolerable a miſchief! Whatſoever I loſe, I ſhall account my ſelf a gainer; if I loſe not the bleſſing which thou wilt give us. Take all if thou pleaſeſt, I am content; ſo thou wilt give me a ſhare in thy glory, when thou comeſt.</hi>

Now vain joyes have ſwelled my heart and puffed me up; and again they have given place to grief, and ſorrow hath ſhrunk up my ſoul, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up my ſpirit. Fears and Hopes have toſſed me up and down, as in a tempeſtuous Sea. A ſmall matter hath created me much trouble; and I have longed for things, which promiſed much, but gave me little ſatisfaction. What a comfort is it, but to expect the day, which will ſettle and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe tumults, in perpetual peace and quiet! I feel the thoughts of it already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50236:71"/>my ſpirit, and bringing a ealm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my breaſt. And if the brightneſs of thy appearing did but always ſhine in my mind, it would diſpel all the clouds and ſcatter the darkneſs, wherein all this confuſion reigns. O let the ſplendor of that day ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiate my ſoul, even at this diſtance from it; and leave no ſpace void of its light and comfort. Yea, let it eclipſe all other joyes; and by its gliſtering beauty, cauſe the ſmall contentments of this world, to ſeem but as ſo many Glow-worms, which ſhine only in the night. I am ſenſible how ſhort the ſweeteſt enjoyments of this life are of that celeſtial happineſs. The ſociety of my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and of the inhabitants above, O how much is it to be preferred, even before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful company of thoſe that moſt deſerve my love! Who can do me no greater ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than by the innocent paſſion I have for them, to tranſport me with far greater, to that bleſſed country; where I ſhall enjoy them without fear, and love them without danger. And O that all the fears I at any time have of loſing the Deareſt Creature in this world, may preſently expire into a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fear of heing ſeparated from my Lord. Let all my hopes and joyes alſo about that, conclude in better hopes and joyful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

I am not afraid of any evil that man, or other creature can do unto me; while my truſt and my joy is in the Lord. Come troubles, come reproaches, come loſs of Goods; I am not angry at it; ſo Jeſus will but come: and they will alſo excite me to faſten mine eyes more ſtedfaſtly on Him and his appearing.

                  <p>I have but one thing more to add, which is; that the Love which deſerves this Character, is a ſetled conſtant affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; an habit and temper of the ſoul which alwayes abides. Not a ſudden fit of paſſion; but a fixed inclination, and rooted diſpoſition to ſeek ſuch a good as it deſires. And ſo the word here uſed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50236:72"/>by St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſignifies, not barely <hi>they that love,</hi> but <hi>they that have loved</hi> his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> being in the time perfectly paſt, denotes that this hath been the ſtedfaſt bent of their hearts to look for Chriſt, and prepare themſelves in this manner for his coming.</p>
                  <p>The Image of any lovely perſon, when it firſt preſents it ſelf before us, is wont to come in a poſture of humility and ſubmiſſion; and ſeems to crave to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into our hearts. It invites us with ſo much ſweetneſs and reſpect; as if it would be beholden to us, for our kind acceptance of it into our favour. But when it is once paſſionately enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and hath poſſeſſed it ſelf of our hearts; we find it changes its behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and grows ſo imperious, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires what before it ſeemed to intreat. It becomes abſolute maſter of our hearts; and placing it ſelf there as the Governor of all our affections, will no more be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any of its demands.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch is the progreſs of the love of Chriſt, and his appearing in pious ſouls. He comes and intreats us at the firſt, or rather beſeeches us that we would be ſo ſenſible of his kindneſs, as to let
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50236:72"/>Him have a room in our hearts; and to receive from His hands ſo great a good, as He offers to bleſs us withall. We feel thereupon only ſome inclinations to Him, and good affections for Him; but do not come preſently to a full reſolution to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render our ſelves intirely to Him. Nay it is too manifeſt, that we are off and on (as the phraſe is) and ſeem as if we could chooſe whether we will love Him or no. But when He hath once got within us, when we perceive how gracious the Lord is, and have opened our hearts to let Him dwell there; then He exerciſes an abſolute Empire over us. He will have none of His commands refuſed or diſputed. A ready and chearful compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with His will, is the fruit of His Authority: and nothing can have a room there, but what ſhall ask Him leave. He rules and reigns over us in ſo ſoveraign a manner, that He carries us whither He pleaſes. And more than that, it pleaſes us to be ruled by Him; and it is the moſt perfect liberty, to be under the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable power of his Love. All the world cannot hinder Him from being obeyed; but every ſignification of his will and pleaſure to us, becomes a Law
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50236:73"/>as ſtrong as Fate, which cannot be reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let him ask what he will, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that he is pleaſed; and that he loves us ſo much, as to think of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again to make us perfectly like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>That's a Good incomparably great, which needs nothing to procure our love to it, but only to be known: And when it is loved, needs nothing to ſecure it, but not to ſlip out of our mind. Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we cannot forget, what we have once ſo dearly loved. The pleaſures of that paſſion are its preſervation. Its activity and force, will not let it dye or fall aſleep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O come, come,</hi> ſaith a ſoul poſſeſſed with this Love, <hi>for I cannot wiſh for any thing like thy appearing. It is impoſſible I ſhould refrain from deſiring that joyful day. I cannot live, but I muſt long for thy coming. O when wilt thou come, my bleſſed Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? when wilt thou come? when ſhall we ſee that welcome morn, that ſhall bring the news of thine approach? It cannot but be moſt welcome ſure to all thoſe that have waited for it with ſo much patience, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50236:73"/>cryed out ſo often,</hi> make no long tarrying, O my Lord. <hi>The brightneſs of thy face, I know, can throw no ſcorching flames in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe eyes that look for thee. That ſweet Sun will ariſe with a ſmiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance upon all ſuch hearts. They can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fear an evil day, when the Bridegroom comes, moſt gloriouſly deckt, to compleat his love to them. And therefore I cannot but ſay again (and let all them that love thee, joyn their deſires with me, and ſay continually) come, come, O bleſſed Jeſus. Come, while our hearts are warm with love to thee. Come, while theſe paſſionate ſighs are calling for thee. Come, now that theſe ſouls ſtand open, with outſtretched arms to receive thee.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>What greater felicity can we wiſh, than to paſs away in ſuch aſpirations towards thee? What gentler or ſweeter breath, than theſe holy deſires, can waft our ſouls into the air to meet thee? Who can fancy any thing more deſireable, than to evaporate, all together, in ecſtaſies of devout affections to thee? Happy were it for us, if our hearts were ſcrued up to ſuch a pitch of love, that we needed no other inſtrument but that, to crack thoſe ſtrings that tye our ſouls to our bodyes. Happy were it for us, if in ſuch
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50236:74"/>a fiery chariot, we might be tranſported un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy heavenly manſions. We can conceive no greater pleaſure than this, to expire in ſuch ardent flames into thy boſom, there to reſt for ever in thy love.</hi>

Let us not deceive our ſelves; this great Apoſtle hath pronounced a curſe upon every one that loves not the Lord Jeſus. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xvj. 20. And he that loves Him, loves his appearing: and he that loveth his appearing, ſets his thoughts, his heart, his deſign ſo much upon it, as to contrive by all means (whatſoever become of him here) that, when Jeſus who is our life ſhall appear, he may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with him in his glory. Riches, Greatneſs, Pleaſures, Fame, Long-life, and all the train that waits upon them, are but as ſo many big names; loud, but empty, ſounds which ſignifie nothing to him; in compariſon with theſe exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great things, the COMING, the APPEARING, the KINGDOM and the GLORY of Chriſt Jeſus. The ſweeteſt Friend in this world, to whom he hath conceived the moſt paſſionate love, will not hinder him from ſeeking theſe: but rather by that love he will be excited to remember with what inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible affection he ought to purſue ſuch divine enjoyments; not only for his own ſoul, but for his ſecond ſelf. The beſt wiſh he can make for both is, that they may be carried with the ſame eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50236:80"/>and haſty ſpeed, to perfect their love in the incomparably greater joys and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of Chriſts heavenly kingdom.</p>
                  <p>So great they are, that, having now finiſhed all that was at firſt propounded to be conſidered on this ſubject, this Love will not be content that I ſhould here make an end. It being ſuch a maſterly affection, and governing the ſoul ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, as hath been related, will not ſuffer us to lay that preſently out of our thoughts, which it hath once planted ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deep in our hearts. It is one of its greateſt pleaſures, to think very much of that Good, whoſe company it doth not yet enjoy: and, when it is far diſtant of it ſelf, to make it preſent by a conſtant image of it in the Mind.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it cannot be any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if we bear a true love to the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, that it will not permit us to be willing to ceaſe our Meditations, on ſo delightful an argument. It doth but act according to its nature, if it require us again to take another view of it; and ſpend a few more thoughts upon ſo bright and glorious an object. And happy were it for us, if it were nothing elſe but mere Love, that made me reſume this Diſcourſe
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50236:81"/>and begin it again; and that made thoſe who read it to be willing or rather deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know further, what are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this heavenly affection, to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of our Lord.</p>
                  <p>For that is it, wherein I intend to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the remainder of my thoughts, upon this ſubject. Love is a paſſion that is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſirous to feel it ſelf; and to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of its own ſincerity, by the ſtrength, and force, and reſtleſneſs of its motion. It fills the heart alſo with ſuch a ſecret joy, that it would fain know the very ſpring of all its delectable motions; and be led to the riſe of every one of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and inclinations. Both the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the variety of its ſurpriſing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are ſo great, that our hearts cannot but be invited thereby to the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it; to ſee from whence it flows, as we perceive whither it tends. And therefore, as I have touched upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cauſe and reaſon of this paſſion of love in the foregoing part of this ſmall Treatiſe: ſo it is not fit to deny it, in the following part, a brief conſideration of the particular reaſons, why it ſhould be ſet upon the appearing of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And they may be reduced to theſe <hi>two</hi> Heads.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The great affection that all good ſouls have for our bleſſed Saviour himſelf: And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The natural affection we all bear to our own good and welfare.</p>
                  <p>Which when we have conſidered, we ſhall be aſhamed that we do not with greater fervour ſay, with reſpect to this, in our daily prayers, THY KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM COME: And be mightily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to call upon our ſouls more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to meditate on <hi>that bleſſed hope,</hi> and <hi>to look,</hi> with much affection, <hi>for the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Who will be ſo much honoured thereby himſelf, and then confer ſuch upon us, as ſhould make us long for the accompliſhment of both.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Reaſons for our Love to this Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drawn from the reſpect we ought to have to our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS for the firſt of theſe, the affection that is due to our bleſſed Saviour, it ought to be ſtrong, you will eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that death it ſelf ſhould not be an equal match for it: That which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers all things, ſhould it ſelf be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by this; and the king of terrors ſhould yield all his force, and yield him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Captive to the love of the King of Love.</p>
               <p>For ſince there is ſo great a power in hearty and unfeigned love, to beget love in thoſe to whom it is expreſſed; and ſince the love whereby our Lord attracts our affection, doth ſo vaſtly exceed all other: it is a prodigious obſtinacy or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50236:82"/>that the dulleſt and heavieſt ſouls are not drawn by ſo big a Loadſtone.</p>
               <p>Do we not feel, as I have ſaid elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, ſome motions of kindneſs in our hearts for the moſt contemptible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; when they conſtantly fawn upon us, and follow us, and lye down by us, and will by no means leave us, but take our part if any body aſſault us? Are we not much pleaſed with this affection they have to us, and concerned for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ready to reward them with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of our love to them? We muſt be infidels then, or very inconſiderate and regardleſs of our bleſſed Saviour; or elſe find our hearts put into the greateſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when we read and ſeriouſly weigh the ſtrange expreſſions, which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath made, of the moſt endearing love to us.</p>
               <p>When we remember Low he neglected himſelf, to ſerve us; how he indured hunger and thirſt, that we might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; how he gave the people the very bread out of his mouth, and forgot to feed himſelf, that he might nouriſh them; when we ſee how he addreſſes himſelf unto us; how he wooes and courts us (to ſpeak in our own language) with the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50236:83"/>greateſt kindneſs to come to him; how ſolicitous he is for our happineſs; how he ſighed for us; how he groaned in ſpirit to ſee men ſo obſtinate; how he ſweat; how he bled; how he gave his very life for us; and was content to be expoſed to the greateſt ſhame, rather than we ſhould periſh; what heart can be ſo inſenſible as not to be mightily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it, and to think of returning back his love, and that in ſome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the wonderful greatneſs of it?</p>
               <p>But then, alas! it muſt be confeſſed that, we find, when our paſſion is ſtirred up, and our hearts begin to burn within us, we have little or nothing there, that is worthy of him. A preſent we would fain make to him, but have none fit to be offered to ſo great a Majeſty. Nay, ſo void many times and empty are our hearts, of all that is good, that we may well be aſhamed to let him ſee them. Our thoughts are ſo dull, and the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have of his kindneſs ſo feeble and weak, that we our ſelves in whom they are, can ſcarce feel them. And at the beſt our affections are ſo ſmall and ſo ſhort, that we cannot but bluſh to come furniſhed with no better oblation to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:50236:83"/>
What ſhall we do in this caſe? How ſhall we behave our ſelves with ſome due regard to his incomprehenſible love? Love him we muſt; but love him as he is worthy, and as we would, we are not able. We cannot chooſe but bring him our hearts, and yet we are ſenſible they are not worth the bringing.</p>
               <p>We ſhall find our ſelves naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, in theſe circumſtances, to do juſt as a grateful Poor man doth; who being unable himſelf to requite a Friends cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies, rejoyces to hear that ſo very great a Perſon will take that care upon him. Or as the Divine Pſalmiſt doth, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own thoughts too ſhort and low, calls upon the Angels, who excel in ſtrength, to ſet forth the praiſes of him, whoſe name is highly exalted above all bleſſing and praiſe. That is, ſince we our ſelves cannot requite the benefits our Lord hath done us, nor worthily magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his goodneſs towards us; we ought in all reaſon to be exceeding deſirous that God, <hi>the Father of glory</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls him) would be pleaſed to reward his love, and make his praiſe glorious. Since there is nothing here whereby we can conſiderably honour him; we muſt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50236:84"/>needs wiſh the day would come, when <hi>the Bleſſed and only Potentate</hi> will ſhow the reſpect he bears unto him.</p>
               <p>As it is a joy to think that he is gone to the Father and there is recompenſed for his ſufferings: ſo it is a matter of greater gladneſs, if we have any love for him, to remember that at his appearing (which he, who is able, will in due time ſhow) he ſhall ſtill be more magnified. This therefore all ſerious Chriſtians can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but much deſire to ſee. For this they cannot but long extreamly; and call with earneſt expectation for the coming of that joyful day. That, ſince they cannot laud and praiſe him enough now, the whole world may then be gathered together, in one general aſſembly, all Angels, and all Men, and with joynt conſent bow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before him, and humbly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be the LORD OF ALL.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall take the liberty, for the clearer underſtanding of this, to give a diſtinct account, in a few conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of that which, we may juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, will accrue to our bleſſed Saviour by his glorious Appearing.</p>

                  <p>And <hi>firſt</hi> of all, there is no doubt but, at his ſecond appearing, our Lord will be <hi>publickly honoured;</hi> and thereby have an amends made him, for the open ſhame and the publick diſgrace, to which he was here expoſed. No Varlet was ever uſed ſo baſely, as the world treated him; when he firſt came to viſit us in much humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. No man was ever the ſubject of ſo much ſcorn, of ſo many ſorrows, and of ſo great pains as he endured. Would it not then be acceptable to you, to ſee his honour every where vindicated; his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, as I may ſay, repaired; and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry made no leſs notorious, than his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches were?</p>
                  <p>Who would not wiſh to ſee that ſweet face (which by rude hands was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly blinded and buffeted) appear in an unveiled brightneſs; looking with the faireſt, the moſt beautiful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eyes upon us?

Are you not impatient to behold that Head, which was inviron'd with Thorns, ſhow it ſelf with a royal Crown upon it?

                  <p>And upon this account we ſhould be the more deſirous to ſee that great day; becauſe till then he will want the glory of having us and all his faithful Subjects, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon him in his heavenly Kingdom. It is a very ſmall glory indeed, you may be apt to think, that he can receive from ſuch poor things as we are.

<note n="*" place="margin">V.S. Chryſ. Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenium, S.

For whom he hath ſuch an affection, and loves us with ſo great tenderneſs; that he doth not think himſelf intirely happy, unleſs we be promoted to be with him where he is, and to reign with him for ever. So much is his heart ſet upon our advancement, that he accounts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be but in part glorious; till we be numbred among his Saints in glory ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
                  <p>Then will he ſhine in greater ſplendor and majeſty than ever; according to thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in another place, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> i. 10. where he ſaith, <hi>He ſhall come to be GLORIFIED in his Saints, and to be ADMIRED in all them that believe.</hi> For <hi>firſt</hi> of all (as <hi>Oecumenius</hi> hath collected the ſenſe of the ancient Fathers about this buſineſs) it will be a glory to him, that he hath ſo many Saints, to whom he will diſtribute his goods, and make illuſtrious with him. For as his riches, ſaith he, is our ſalvation, ſo it will be a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to him. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> He will be glorified alſo by his Saints, when they ſhall behold him ſitting <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50236:91"/>the ſpiritual powers, when they ſhall ſee what a recompenſe of reward he hath vouchſafed to his ſervants. Who as they ſhall give occaſion to his being <hi>glorified,</hi> ſo to his being <hi>admired</hi> alſo: becauſe it will be a moſt wonderful and amazing ſight to ſee thoſe, who were thought ſo vile and abject in this preſent life that they were perſecuted and murdered, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy then of ſuch and ſo great good things as he will beſtow upon them.</p>
                  <p>And truly, as our Lord will be thus magnified and admired at that day; ſo this ought now to be very wonderful in our eyes. Who have little conſideration, if we be not exceedingly in love with his appearing; when ſelf-love ſo ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines and prompts our affection to it.

So great, that no ſoul, who is poſſeſſed with a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſe of it, can be tempted any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to envy the greatneſs of the nobleſt Perſons; no, not the high dignity of the bleſſed Angels. The brighteſt of the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins ſhould not be ſo grievous to us, as to hurt our eyes; nor the flames of the Seraphims touch us with the leaſt ſpark of indignation, to ſee our ſelves ſo much excelled by them: But we ſhould rather wiſh they were more glorious and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious; becauſe the greater they are, the greater will the advancement of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be, which, at the appearing of Chriſt, will ſhine in a place ſo far above the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe heavenly Creatures indeed are ſo ſplendid; that we poor mortals, even the holieſt of us, were wont to be afraid at their appearance. They are too glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering for our weak eyes to behold: too full of luſtre, for us, who dwell in theſe caves of darkneſs, to converſe withall. Whence it was, that ſome pious people, in ancient times, preſently concluded they ſhould dye, if they ſaw an Angel: imagining that his buſineſs, when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, was to fetch their ſouls from their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50236:94"/>bodies; in which while they lived, they were not fit for ſuch Society. And other excellent perſons were ſo amazed at the glory of theſe celeſtial Miniſters, that they thought of paying them no leſs than religious honour; and prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to fall down before them and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them as Gods.</p>
                  <p>O what an happineſs then will it be, to ſee our Natures ſo improved and exalted; that we ſhall be able to entertain their company, without any trembling at all: and inſtead of thoſe paralytick fears, be only ſtruck with a delightful ſenſe of the moſt harmonious joyes? What a glory will it be unto us, what a joy, to find our ſelves made equal to thoſe, whom we took for Gods? To behold our ſelves as bright as thoſe celeſtial fires; which were wont to dazzle the eyes of the greateſt ſouls, and poſſeſs them with an apprehenſion, that they were Divine Beings?</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially we ought to conſider, what an honour, what a ſatisfaction it will be, to behold, not ſo few as one, or two, or a thouſand of thoſe beautiful Creatures but, the whole Heavenly Court, (whom we were ready to adore) come

A moſt glorious and delightful ſight it will be, to behold him in the head of all thoſe Heavenly Hoſts: to ſee all the air filled, with the ſeveral Legions of Holy Angels: to behold every Troop in that glorious Camp, paying their reſpect to our far more glorious Lord; and with their ſhouts and joyful acclamations following him, as their General and chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander: And all the Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs likewiſe crouching at his feet, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at his Majeſtick Preſence, diſarmed of all their weapons, and confeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Captives and Slaves of this victorious Prince, Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50236:97"/>clearly diſcerned that he was <hi>God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh.</hi> They have aſſured us that he was born of a ſpotleſs Virgin; that his name was <hi>Jeſus;</hi> that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Son of God, by voices from Heaven, and by the deſcent of the Holy-Ghoſt in a viſible manner upon his head; and yet that he was contented to become poor and mean, that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich us; to ſuffer his hands, and his feet, and his heart to be pierced, that he might heal our wounds: yea, we have heard that he deſcended into the lowermoſt parts of the Earth for our Salvation; and that he roſe from the dead again after three dayes; and that he aſcended up on high, and now ſits at the right hand of the Father; and will come again to judge the world, and to take up his faithful Servants unto himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And moſt comfortable news all this is, which hath arrived at our ears; and we muſt needs with all thankfulneſs dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge, that we are marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly beholden to the Almighty Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which hath taken ſuch care to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and fully aſſure us of its truth.

                     <hi>When will he come again; that then we may ſee, as now we believe the certain truth of all this; which we have heard of him with our ears? When ſhall we be ſatisfied by ſuch evidence as the Apoſtles, and other of his Attendants had; who beheld his perſon, and ſaw his glory,</hi> as the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth? <hi>May not we alſo hope to be as they were,</hi> eye-witneſſes of his Majeſty?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O when will his holy Angels deſcend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and ſay, as they did to them; Come, and ſee that he is riſen? When ſhall we hear a voice from Heaven, ſaying; come up hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and behold my beloved Son, in whom I am ever well pleaſed? When will the trump of the Archangel ſound; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim in all our ears, that he is Judge of quick and dead? O how many days muſt we ſtay and wait, before we riſe again, to aſcend up to him where he is? How long will it be, before we leave this earth, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him exalted at the right hand of the Majeſty on high?</hi>

                     <hi>O moſt gracious Saviour, who haſt done ſuch great things for us; Come, and let us ſee that thou art alive, and ſtill loveſt us! Come, and put us out of all doubt, that thou liveſt for evermore! Let us behold thoſe bright,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50236:98"/>thoſe loving eyes, which wept ſo oft, and with ſo much kindneſs over us! Let us ſee that ſweet, and now moſt glorious face; which ſweat as it had been drops of blood for our ſake! Stretch forth thoſe hands, that were wounded in our ſervice; O ſtretch them out, to lay hold on us, and lift us up to the viſion of thee! Do not long defer, before thou letteſt us enjoy, what we now believe. Make no long tarrying, O bleſſed Lord, but turn the faith of thy ſervants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſight. And by thy ſecond appearing, be pleaſed to make us as ſure, as thou didſt thoſe, who then lived, by thy firſt.</hi>

                     <hi>We are perſwaded that the fame of thoſe things which we wait for, is nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the ſight of them. We cannot but think that all preſent reports fall far ſhort, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſhort of future enjoyment. Thy type, the great</hi> Solomon, <hi>O Lord, puts us in mind of thee; and makes us more deſirous to ſee thee.

                     <hi>Nay, we believe we cannot now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thy greatneſs, if it ſhould be all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to us. If we ſhould ſee thee as thou art, in thy royal apparel, on the Throne of thy Glory, with all thy Heavenly Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants and noble Miniſters round about thee;</hi> there would be no more ſpirit left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us. <hi>We ſhould faint away under the weight of that ſight; unleſs thou, O Lord, wouldſt disburden us of this fleſh, and make us become all Spirit.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And that's the happineſs indeed, which we deſire; and groan in Spirit till we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. There is no greater good we can wiſh, than to be caught up from this earth; and have eyes beſtowed upon us, bright and ſtrong enough to behold thy Majeſty. We cannot but long for this; that we may ſtand in thy preſence, and be ſatisfied with thee: that we may ſee thee, who haſt loved us, and given thy ſelf for us: thee whoſe love hath won our hearts, and conducted us thus far in our way towards thee: thee who art our hope; and with whom our life is hid: That we may ſee thee, O Lord, in the height of thy glory, and thy face may ſhine upon us, and our eyes ſparkle for joy with the light of thy Countenance: Of which we are the more deſirous, becauſe we

                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>And there is ſtill a greater reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, and to be in love with his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; becauſe then we hope to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and conſummated in Love.</p>
                  <p>This is an affection, you have heard, ſo pleaſurable; that we are inticed thereby, or rather ſweetly forced to ſtrain our ſouls to the utmoſt expreſſion of it. When we have found an object worthy of this paſſion, the delight it gives us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, nay compels, our hearts to the moſt abundant effuſion of it; that ſo we may not want the higheſt degree of delight and joy.</p>
                  <p>But alas! Love in this world, though exceeding ſweet, is not, as we uſually ſpeak, all Hony; but there is ſome bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs mingled together with it. The heart that is ſtruck with it receives a wound (which cannot be perfectly heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50236:100"/>till it enjoys its deſires) and that you know is not without the company of anguiſh and pain.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For we find that when men admit into their hearts the love of any mortal creature like themſelves, the ſoul which before was whole, unbroken and intire, is as it were ſeparated and torn by this paſſion, both from it ſelf and all other objects; ſave only that which hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged its affection. Now all men know that no heart can be thus parted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, without a ſenſe of grief and ſmart, attending on ſuch a divulſion and rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it from it ſelf: till it feel that ſoul, which it loves as another ſelf, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually joyned to it.</p>
                  <p>And then (2.) we find that after it hath obtained well aſſured hopes of this; yet thoſe eager deſires and longings that are in this paſſion, ſtill carry their ſting in them; and make the heart but ill at eaſe until they be accompliſhed. Both which it were eaſie to apply to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout affection, wherewith pious ſouls are touched towards our bleſſed Saviour; which is very unquiet and full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, till they know and feel that he loves them.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:50236:100"/>
3. But I ſhall rather obſerve (which is peculiar to this holy love) that the wounds, as I may call them, which are made in any heart by the wonderful kindneſs of our Saviour, who loved us ſo much as to dye for us, are wont very oft to be a torment to it; becauſe it can love him no more, and doth not feel ſuch ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement tranſports of affection to him, as it deſires, and he hath merited.</p>
                  <p>And then (4.) though we are fully perſwaded that we do ſincerely and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love him; yet this proves a great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us, here in this preſent ſtate, that we fancy him ſometimes to be a ſtranger to us; and he ſeems to treat us, as if he were ſuſpicious of our Love.</p>
                  <p>And (5.) when we have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe of his moſt tender mercies, and he ſheds abroad his love in our hearts; This creates a new grief, becauſe he ſtays no longer with us, and we cannot call him back, as oft as we pleaſe, to give us thoſe delicious taſtes of his infinite Love.</p>
                  <p>But (6.) there is nothing ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this matter, as that we cannot enjoy thoſe gracious viſits from our Lord (of which we are ſo deſirous, and which
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50236:101"/>fill the heart with the greateſt love to him and delight in him (but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in ſighs and groans, and leave us much unſatisfied, while we are in this mortal body. That very love which God himſelf excites, thoſe Heavenly impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which his own hand makes upon our hearts, the greateſt ardors of divine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection wherewith we are inſpired from above; are not without their pangs of trouble in all thoſe, who with earneſt intention of mind and moſt hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, give up themſelves to follow them, and ſeriouſly endeavour to comply with them.</p>
                  <p>For while a devout ſoul (that is in a lively manner touched by him) ſtretches its wings, as I may ſay, and ſpreads it ſelf with great affection that it may mount up in vehement love unto him; It preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feels how unable it is to anſwer thoſe divine motions, and ſees, to its ſorrow, that its wings are not grown large enough, to bear it ſo high, as it then aſpires. There is a powerful ſpirit indeed, which ſtimulates it to fly aloft, where he is; but while it endeavours to obey its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, it is ſtrongly dragged and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down by the earthly tabernacle, to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50236:101"/>theſe inferiour enjoyments. It is born away with violent and ſwift deſires; and at the ſame time ſinks below, and ſadly flaggs for want of power.</p>
                  <p>Like the Bird that is not yet fully fledg'd, which would fain fly when it hears the Mother call; but finding its wings too weak, is forced to fall into ſome hedge or tree, and there is content to hop up and down, and pleaſe it ſelf in its lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle chirpings among the branches: ſo doth the devout ſoul feel it ſelf when it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſirous to correſpond with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly motions that are ſtirring in it; and when it thinks it hears the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſaying, Come up hither. It fails in the attempt; and can only make ſome ſmall, but feeble, eſſays towards its celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al country. It is ſoon tired and grows weary; and while it pants and breaths after high and excellent things, cannot reach them or come nigh them: but faints away and ſpends it ſelf in ſighs, which are ſo much the ſadder; becauſe it ſees the ſpatious Heavens before its eyes, and yet muſt be content to drop down and ſit ſtill upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Yea, the very ſtretching of her wings puts the ſoul to pain, when ſhe cannot
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50236:102"/>fly. The ſtraining of her ſelf is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie; when ſhe can only groan, but not raiſe up her ſelf to the pitch that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. She ſuffers a kind of torment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two; the ſtrength of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and the weakneſs of her ability; the ſharpneſs of her ſight, and the dulneſs of her enjoyment.</p>

O what a joyful name is this of Life, and of life for evermore! How ſweetly doth, even the word, IMMORTALITY ſound, in this land of death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? What is it that makes our hearts ſo cold, and to feel ſo few deſires to ſee the Prince of Life appear? To ſee Him, who ſhall raiſe up that in glory and power, which was put into the earth in diſhonour and weakneſs; and ſhall turn this natural, this corruptible body, into one that is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and incorruptible?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Are we afraid this world will be burnt up by the brightneſs of his appearing? Do we pity our Palaces and coſtly Furniture, which we think are then in danger to be conſumed? Are we concerned for our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Jewels, our ancient Demeſn and places of pleaſure, our Pictures and Statues, with ſuch like things, which we ſtrive to perpetuate to all poſterity? Will all theſe, do we fear, be in a flame? and ſerve for no
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50236:106"/>other uſe than thoſe great Fires do, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we honour the Coronations and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Kings, or any other ſuch like noble ſpectacle?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let it be ſo; I ſee no cauſe to be troubled at it: when I remember that together with theſe, the Graves and the Sepulchres, the Tombs and ſuch like Monuments of Deaths conqueſts, the Vaults and the Charnel-houſes, with every other Trophee that ſin hath erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhall be caſt into this huge Bonfire; which ſhall be made, we conceive, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of this Globe of earth, to adorn our Saviours Triumph.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Why ſhould we dread, O my ſoul, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſuch Flames as theſe? Let us look and fix our eyes upon them as moſt cheerful bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes. Let us warm our hearts, at the very thoughts of ſuch fires. And though they ſhould prove to be this worlds Funeral; yet let us rejoyce in them as accompanying our moſt happy Reſurrection.</hi>

                     <hi>O Death, I fear none of thy threatnings. O Grave, I am not aſtoniſht any longer at thy darkneſs. I ſee the fatal day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ſhall put an end to both your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. And till then, I yield my ſelf your ſubject, and intend not to ſtruggle againſt your power. But</hi> I <hi>fear it not: becauſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

                     <hi>It is not much you can rob me of at preſent. The pleaſures we enjoy in this crazy body, are not ſo conſiderable, that we ſhould migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily lament the loſs of them. Our Friends indeed have taken ſuch faſt hold of our hearts, that we cannot eaſily conſent to leave them: but ſetting them aſide, what is it that you can take away, which I am loth to part withal? And they, I conſider, ſhall at laſt triumph together with me, over your now prevailing power. We ſhall only part, to meet again, and ſee you ſwallowed up in victory. And we ſhall be revived in bodies far more glorious, with hearts full of more vigorous love. In which we ſhall live with endleſs pleaſure; without any fears of being ſevered any more.</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <p>We cannot but be inclined to ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, and bear an affectionate love to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50236:107"/>our Lords appearing, unleſs we be in love with Sin; which at that time (we ſhould further conſider) ſhall quite ceaſe, and not have ſo much as the leaſt ſhadow of it remaining.</p>
                  <p>Are not all pious ſouls very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, to think that God is every where ſo much dishonoured? Is it not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grievous to them, to ſee his moſt high authority daily affronted, without any remedy for it? and that Image he hath placed of himſelf in man, after ſuch a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable manner, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, continually mangled? Nay, is it not a conſiderable part of their trouble, that they are afraid leſt, through the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of temptations, or the weakneſs of their nature, or the inadvertency of their minds, by ſudden ſurpriſes, they ſhould add to the number of thoſe diſorders which are already ſo prodigiouſly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? What is there then, for which they can more reaſonably wiſh; than that they may be delivered out of this fearful dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the Heavens may be ſecured from this rude violence?</p>
                  <p>A bleſſing to be deſired and expected not only upon their own account, but in reſpect to our bleſſed Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50236:108"/>alſo, who is now, we read, in the moſt holy place above, there preſenting himſelf, with his pretious blood, before God for us. Which he muſt continue to do, till the time of his Appearing be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; when he ſhall come out from thence <hi>without ſin</hi> (ix.

This is the conſtant imployment of his high and Royal Prieſthood, and it cannot ceaſe till he come out again, on the day of his appearing: which, it is manifeſt, will free both him and the world from this great burden of tranſgreſſions.</p>
                  <p>Then there ſhall never be any more objects of his pity and compaſſion. He ſhall have no ſenſe then of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; no feeling of our pains, our grief and our anguiſh.

And ſhall not the thoughts of this bleſſed time be our joy and pleaſure too? We have very much reaſon to ſuſpect our faith, if we can find ſuch contentment here, that we would not have it make too much haſte: For nothing is ſo ſad to pious hearts, as that it ſeems to be ſo far off, and comes ſo ſlowly to them. They groan and ſigh here under many weakneſſes. They complain moſt heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and mourn under the weight of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imperfections. From which they would fain be delivered; that they may turn their ſighs, into ſongs of praiſe to the triumphant Captain of their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Nay, ſhould we ſuppoſe there will be a time, before the end of all things, when righteouſneſs will more univerſally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; which is the beſt ſenſe that can be made of the Saints reigning upon the earth with Chriſt a thouſand years (which ſome are perſwaded is ſtill to come:) Yet ſuch and ſo many are the weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that will hang upon us, and ſo great are the dangers to which they will make us ſubject, while we dwell in theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tabernacles, that Good men would but be the more deſirous our Lord would

                     <hi>I am forced indeed to ſigh, when I think of the many temptations to which, on every ſide, I am expoſed.

Bleſſed be thy Almighty Grace, that I have ſtood hitherto ſo ſtedfaſt, ſo unmoveable in my duty: and that I have thy word for it, thou wilt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave me nor forſake me. It is only my love to thee, which makes me complain, though not of the inconſtancy yet, of the weakneſs of my love. The coldneſs of my affections, the liſtleſſneſs of my devotions, my aptneſs to be tired and ſoon weary of the divineſt pleaſure and ſatisfaction, the unevenneſs of my temper, the ſudden diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſures I feel in my ſpirit, are the things that often trouble me.</hi>

                  <p>And if you well obſerve it, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teaches you to believe, that this aſcent of the Saints unto him, will bein a very glorious manner.

Heretofore, indeed, I fancied nothing more than a body freſh and plump, a tall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtature, a fair face and beautiful features; and I was prone to envy thoſe who dwelt in ſuch fine and goodly Palaces: But ever ſince the time that I heard of going into the air, to meet with thee, my Lord; all the love they excite in my heart, makes ſuch habitations ſeem no better than ſtately Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.

And if I have a mind to begin my journey thither preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if I would fain feel my wings ſo grown that they might be able to bear me up above this earth, if my ſoul ſometimes would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be releaſed from theſe chains, and have the freedom to leave this fleſh, and if I wiſh withal that this fleſh may be changed, and turned into a kind of ſpiritual being; I muſt aſcribe it unto thee, who haſt begot theſe deſires in me; by telling me of a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God eternal in the Heavens, when this earthly tabernacle is diſſolved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou haſt revealed theſe things to me, that I might deſire them; and who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them, and not wiſh withal that he might preſently enjoy them? Let it not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe thee therefore, I beſeech thee again, O my Deareſt Lord; if I ſay ſometimes, I am weary of being here. Do not eſteem me impatient, if, in the agonies and pangs
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50236:115"/>of Love, I long to come up higher, and get as near as may be to thy ſelf. Suffer me to pray thee, that theſe walls of fleſh may not long immure me, and exclude me from thy face. At leaſt open a window for my gaſping ſoul; that I may look into the purer air; and pleaſe my ſelf in the thoughts of the flight which I ſhall one day take, to ſee thee and enjoy thee in unclouded Bliſs.</hi>

                  <p>But there is ſomething beyond all this, to draw our affections from all things here, and to make us love and long for the coming of our Lord: And that is, the CROWN OF RIGHTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUSNESS, which the Apoſtle tells us, in this very place, ſhall then be given to all thoſe, who are thus piouſly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for it.</p>
                  <p>I cannot tell you how much is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe two words; unleſs I ſhould make another Treatiſe little leſs than this. For a CROWN denotes the higheſt degree of honour; and RIGHTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUSNESS ſignifies, in the holy lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, not only freedom from all pain and puniſhment, but the enjoyment of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50236:115"/>the greateſt felicity, that the moſt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous goodneſs of God will beſtow upon his faithful ſervants. No leſs than ſuch a glory and happineſs, as our Lord himſelf hath received, for a reward of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. For <hi>we ſee Jeſus</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ij. Heb. 9.) <hi>who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the ſuffering of death, CROWNED with glory and honour.</hi> So St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw him in a viſion (as he tells us xiv. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.) ſitting upon a <hi>white</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> a bright and ſhining) <hi>cloud, having on his head A GOLDEN CROWN.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus our Lord hath cauſed it to be proclaimed, in the Goſpel of his Grace, it ſhall be done to all thoſe whom God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to honour. He hath ſhown in our bleſſed Saviour, what he will beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his conſtant followers. And in what he hath done for him, he hath ſhown al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that <hi>he is upright, and that there is no unrighteouſneſs in him.</hi> They may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his word, and be confident he will not fail their expectation; but crown their faith and patience with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal glory.</p>
                  <p>I ſay their patience, becauſe he will have them wait long, and ſtay a great
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50236:116"/>while before they receive this Crown; which cannot be ſet upon their heads till the day of his Appearing. He will take up all pious Souls indeed into a ſtate of joy and bliſs, ſurpaſſing all that we can now conceive, as ſoon as they depart this life; but the perfection of it they muſt wait for till he have gathered the whole body of the faithful to him, that he may crown them all together.

                  <p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50236:117"/>places, they live at eaſe, with great tranquillity, invironed with the guards of Angels. And the <hi>Fifth Order</hi> or Rank, hath the ſweetneſs of a moſt plentiful exultation or triumph, that they are eſcaped, out of the priſon of this corruptible body, into light and liberty; and poſſeſs the promiſed inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. For there is an order of the reſt, as there is of the reſurrection. We ſhall all riſe, <hi>but every one in his order. Chriſt the firſt-fruits, then they that are Chriſts, who believe his coming: and then is the end.</hi> There ſhall be therefore a different order of dignity and glory, as there will be an order of deſerts. So that in the <hi>ſixth Order,</hi> their Countenance will begin to ſhine as the Sun, and to be compared to the lights of the ſtars: but is ſuch a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as cannot decay. And the <hi>ſeventh Order</hi> will be, that they may exult with confidence and full aſſurance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide without any doubting, and rejoyce without trembling; making haſte to ſee his Countenance, to whom they have devoted the Obedience of a moſt diligent ſervice. From whence, by the remembrance of an innocent Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50236:118"/>they may preſume a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a ſmall labour: which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to receive, ſhall know that the ſufferings of this preſent time are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy that ſo great a glory of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal recompenſe ſhould be compared with them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Order wherein he places juſt ſouls before our Lord come to bring them into his heavenly Kingdom. And ſome body under the name of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath more briefly expreſſed it thus.
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>L. de ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutaribus Documen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> c. xl. Tom. 4.</note> 
                     <q>We believe that when our ſoul is freed from the bonds of the fleſh, if we have lived well and uprightly before God, the Quire of Angels will preſently come to meet us, and troops of all the Saints will run into our embraces; and bring us to ſupplicate the true Judge. Then peace will incompaſs us, and deep ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. We ſhall fear no more the fiery darts of the Devil, nor any other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that deſires to caſt our ſouls into danger. Not ſword, not fire, not the cruel face of the Tormentor, not hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, not thirſt, nor any ſickneſs. The fleſh ſhall no longer be contrary to the ſpirit; nor ſhall we fear any danger: but having caſt off the burden of the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50236:118"/>fleſh, the holy Spirit, (to whom we had before given a manſion in our body) will give us a manſion in Heaven. And ſo we ſhall joyfully and gladly expect the day of judgement; in which the ſouls of all men ſhall receive rewards according to their deeds.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that place and ſtate into which we ſhall be admitted then, they call <hi>the Higheſt Heaven; the Inner Altar; above the Altar; the Houſe of God; the Seat of Chriſt; the Celeſtial Kingdom; the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance; the goods of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the conſummation of glory; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of immortality; the diſtribution of royal donatives; perfect joy; the expected reward; the end of all good; the intire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of deſerts; the time of Crowns; the kingdom of fruition; the perfect participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good things;</hi> with other names of the like import; which ſignifie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing much beyond what we ſhall enjoy before our Lords appearing.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude what they ſay of both theſe ſtates, with the words of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tract. xlix.</note> in his expoſition upon St. <hi>John.</hi> 
                     <q>All ſouls, ſaith he, when they go out of this world, have their different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: the good have joy, and the evil
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50236:119"/>have torment. But when there ſhall be a reſurrection, the joy of the good ſhall be more ample, and the torment of the bad more grievous. The holy Patriarchs are received in peace, and ſo are Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, and the good Faithful: but all theſe are ſtill in the end to receive that which God hath promiſed. For even the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the fleſh is promiſed, the conſumption of death, and eternal life with the Angels. This we ſhall all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive together: But as for the Reſt which is given preſently after death, every man receives it, if he be worthy of it, when he departs from hence. The Patriarchs received it firſt, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Prophets, and more lately the Apoſtles, and ſtill more lately the holy Martyrs, and every day the good Faithful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And with theſe more ancient words of <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> who diſcourſes in this manner. <q>Since our Lord went away in the midſt of the ſhadow of death, to that place where the ſouls of the dead are; and afterward was raiſed corporally; and after his reſurrection was taken up into Heaven; It is manifeſt that the ſouls
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50236:119"/>of his Diſciples alſo (for whom the Lord wrought theſe things) ſhall go into the inviſible place appointed to them by God; and ſhall ſtay there till the Reſurrection, expecting the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: Afterward receiving their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and riſing again perfectly, that is corporally, as our Lord alſo roſe again, ſo they ſhall come to the ſight of God. For no Diſciple is above his Maſter; but every one that is perfect ſhall be as his Maſter. As our Lord therefore did not ſtraightway, flying from hence, depart to Heaven, but expecting the time of the Reſurrection appointed of the Father (which was fore-ſignified in <hi>Jonas</hi>) after three days riſing again, was taken up into Heaven: even ſo we alſo ought to wait with patience the time appointed by God for our Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, fore-told by the Prophets; and ſo riſing again be taken up, as many of us as the Lord ſhall account worthy of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whoſoever ſhall be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that world (as our Lord ſpeaks) and of the reſurrection of the dead, they will be filled, no doubt, with inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable joy, to meet ſo many pious ſouls,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50236:120"/>and ſo many Friends, who will be all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at that time to receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they have ſo long waited for. <hi>For if all the Faithful be one body</hi> (as St.
<note place="margin">In xi. Heb. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> or the Author of the Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the <hi>Hebrews</hi> *, under his name, ſpeaks) <hi>it will be a greater pleaſure to this body to be Crowned all together, than if it ſhould be done by parts. For the righteous even in this are admirable, that they rejoyce in the good of their Brethren, as well as their own: and therefore this will be according to their hearts deſire, that they ſhall be Crowned with their fellow members; For it is a great ſatisfaction to be glorified together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of which ſince we have ſo ſure an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, <q>and the juſt (as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaks in the place fore-mentioned) have ſuch a recompenſe, that they ſhall ſee the face of God, and behold that light which inlightens every man; what ſhould we all do from hence forward, but, as he ſays, put on this reſolution, and ſtudy that our ſouls may draw near to God, that our prayer may draw near to him, that our deſire may cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and we may never be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him? Even while we remain
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50236:120"/>here, let us be faſt knit to God, by meditating, by reading, by ſeeking, and endeavour to know him as we are able. For we know here but in part; becauſe all things here are imperfect, there in their perfection. Here we are little Children; there we ſhall be ſtrong men. We ſee here, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as in a glaſs darkly; but there face to face. There with open face we ſhall behold the glory of God; which here our ſouls being involved in fleſh and blood, and ſullied with their ſpots, cannot behold ſincere. For who, ſaith he, can ſee my face and live? How ſhould we? ſince our eyes cannot endure ſo much as the rayes of the Sun; which would put them out if we ſhould fix them on ſo great a light. How can we behold then the ſhining Countenance of our Creator, while we are wrapt up in the rags of this fleſh?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt ſtay for ſo glorious a ſight till that happy day, when we ſhall be unclothed, or rather clothed upon, with the garments of celeſtial light. That's the time and not till then, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to do us the great honour, of ſetting the Crown of righteouſneſs upon our
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50236:121"/>heads. Now is the time of toils (as he ſpeaks in another place) of agonies, of combates, of conflicts, of ſtrife for Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: then is the time of refreſhments, of crowns, of retributions, of rewards, of reſurrection, and of the reſtitution of all things. Which ought to make all ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Believers, look for that day with carneſt longings; and lift up their heads above this viſible world, as men deſirous to receive this glorious Diadem. In compariſon with which, the moſt good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fillets that ever bound any Imperial brow, are not worthy ſo much as to be named.</p>

My head beats and akes, and cannot be at reſt, till this Crown, by his royal hand, be ſet upon it.

                  <p>I Have already ſaid ſo much of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs we expect, when our Lord ſhall come again, that here I might put an end to this Diſcourſe: if it would not be more profitable diſtinctly to conſider, that after we are caught up from this earth to meet the Lord in the air, and he hath done us honour in the ſight of all the world; we ſhall all (as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuggeſted) march with him unto Heaven, in goodly array, and comely order, with thoſe Crowns of Glory, which he hath given us, upon our heads. This ſhould mightily move us to love his Appearing; that we ſhall
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50236:124"/>then appear together with him: and not abide in the Air, though incompaſſed with ſo much glory; but be carried up with him, far higher, into the pureſt sky.</p>
                  <p>When our minds are made all Light, we ſhall ſee a vaſt way before us; and behold the Palace where God himſelf dwells, inviting us unto it. Thither our Lord will have us attend upon him and accompany him; when he hath finiſhed the judgement of the great day. Where the Holy Books inform us we ſhall be ſumptuouſly treated; with no leſs kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, magnificence and joy, than a King, we may conceive, would entertain his only Son, when he brought home his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Bride, whom he had long ago eſpouſed to himſelf: For whoſe recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he prepares the moſt Royal Supper, a glorious Marriage-Feaſt, to welcome her unto his houſe.</p>
                  <p>And will not this make every faithful ſoul, who is a holy member of that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the Church, whom our Lord is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to own for his Bride, ſtill more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, if not impatient, of the coming of the celeſtial Bridegroom; to perfect his love, and complete the promiſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50236:124"/>he ſtands ingaged, by the gracious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant he made with us when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted us to himſelf? What is there that we all ſo much covet as the exceſs of joy, and the higheſt pitch of pleaſure? And where are theſe to be found in ſo much purity, in ſuch fulneſs, and ſo perpetual, as in his moſt bleſſed Preſence? Which ſhould force us to burſt out with the greateſt earneſtneſs, when we think of that Heavenly Feaſt which he hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for us, into ſuch expreſſions as thoſe of <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Hart panteth after the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul, after thee, O God. My ſoul thirſteth for God, even the living God; O when ſhall I come and appear before God? <hi>I have ſmall ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, alas! in theſe dull, and ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, which I find on earth. What taſte is there in this green traſh? And there is little other fruit that grows in the garden of this world, but what is ſowre and harſh, and ſets my teeth on edge. It is too far from thy beams, to bring forth any thing very ſweet. Nothing can be ripened at this diſtance from thee, to ſatisfie a font

                     <hi>Bring me therefore into thy Paradiſe above, O conduct me into thy</hi> Eden, <hi>the Garden of thy delights. Lead me to thoſe fruits, which are brought to maturity by the conſtant preſence of the Sun of righteouſneſs. Let me feaſt on thoſe pleaſures, which are all pleaſure: and enter into the joy, which is fulneſs of joy for evermore.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And till thou thinkeſt me meet for ſuch entertainments; may it pleaſe thy love, but to give me ſome taſts of their incomparable ſweetneſs! May I reliſh no joys ſo much as thoſe! May I always have the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them freſh upon my ſoul! And may I be ſo happy as to be preſerved, by the ſavour of them, from the ſinful allurements of all other pleaſures!</hi>

                  <p>

Stand aſide you Images of true joy, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not my proſpect of that heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. Lend me your help, or elſe get you gone, and trouble me no more. Aſſiſt my benighted thoughts, and repreſent that bliſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place to them; or elſe I deſire not your company. I have eaten of all your dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but ſtill am empty and void of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. I know what you have to ſay, the

What heart is there, that is ſo dull as not to long to dwell in that bleſſed place; where every head wears a Crown of Life, and every hand carries a Palm of Victory? Where every eye overflows with joy, and every tongue with Pſalms of praiſe? Where light ſhines in every face; and love ſmiles in every Countenance? Where every heart is perfectly ſatisfied, in the fulneſs of its own bliſs: and ſatisfied again with the pleaſure it hath, to ſee the felicity of others?</hi>

I ſigh to think that I ſtand at ſuch a diſtance from my Fathers Houſe; and ſhall I ſuffer a further remove, by turning away my eyes from thence? Go, O my ſoul, go thither in thy thoughts and daily medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Send a thouſand wiſhes before thee thither; to tell thy Lord that thou art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him.</hi>

What have I on Earth, but my hope by following thee, to arrive at laſt where thou art gone before me? Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould I look, but unto Heaven; now that thou, my Deareſt Lord, art aſcended thither, to prepare a place for me? A place of reſt, and ſecure peace; a place of joy, and conſtant enjoyment; a place from whence I am loth my thoughts or my heart ſhould deſcend, to return to this poor earth again: for there they grow ſo dull, that it is hard to lift them up, to look to thee.</hi>

                     <hi>O keep them with thee, keep them with thee; thou King of Heaven!

                  <p>And when theſe things ſhall be fulfilled, the Apoſtle tells us, in the place before named (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iv. 17.) that we ſhall be ALWAYS WITH THE LORD: who paſſed his promiſe to his Diſciples a little before he left the world, that he would <hi>come again, and receive them to himſelf, that where he is, there they may be alſo,</hi> xiv. John 3. Of which promiſe he was ſo mindful after he went to Heaven, that he further informs St. <hi>Paul</hi> (who ſpake this, <hi>by the word of the Lord</hi>) that he will not part with us, when he hath conducted us to his Fathers houſe; but keep us <hi>ever</hi> with him there; in joys and pleaſures that never fade away.</p>
                  <p>A condition which we cannot but love and paſſionately long for, if we have any love for him or for our ſelves. For there are none of our enjoyments here, but muſt be frequently intermitted, and are too often interrupted: even the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our bleſſed Lord himſelf, and the ſenſe he gives us of celeſtial things, we find, to our ſorrow, ſuffers this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50236:127"/>Neither are we diverted from them only by the troubles of this life, or the violence of other worldly temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which preſs too boldly and rudely upon us: but by the moſt neceſſary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the moſt innocent fruitions; to which nature not only inclines us, but requires our frequent attendance.</p>
                  <p>Of how much of our time doth ſleep poſſeſs it ſelf, though we deſire never ſo earneſtly to continue awake? How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle do we live in the account of reaſon; if we do but remember this Image of Death, which hath us ſo many hours, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night, in its arms? And yet beſides this, eating and drinking, journeys and viſits, the buſineſſes and cares of this life, which challenge ſome of our thoughts, devour, no body knows how great, a portion of every day. To ſay nothing of thoſe hours, when we are fit for little or nothing; but are forced to find, as we ſignificantly ſpeak, ſome paſtime for the entertainment of our wearied minds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O bleſſed Jeſus, how few are the minutes, that theſe ſouls, incloſed in fleſh, can ſpend in thy company? Into what a little room
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50236:127"/>are the thoughts of thee, and of thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable love, moſt wretchedly crowded? How ſoon are we weary, and how often are we forced away; when we have the greateſt mind to thy ſweet Society? O the cares that not only divert, but ſometimes oppreſs us! O the multitude of troubles which are wont to diſquiet us! the ſickneſſes and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of our bodies, which indiſpoſe us! beſides the great weakneſs and feebleneſs of theſe ſpirits, which are not able long to bear thee company!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is but a wiſh, I ſee, that I may always ſtay with thee. I feel my ſelf pulled away, and cannot keep my ſoul above, even when thou haſt lifted it up unto thee. And therefore I cannot but renew my deſires, that thou wouldeſt be pleaſed to haſten thy coming. That's the time I long to ſee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would be ever with thee, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways behold thy face; and perpetually ſpeak of thee; and declare thy love without ceaſing, in the height of love and devotion to thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O what a change will that day make in me; when I ſhall be all Life, and ſee not ſo much as the image or ſhadow of death any more? When I ſhall neither ſlumber nor ſleep, much leſs be ſick, or grow old and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50236:128"/>dye; but always wake, and enjoy a perfect health, a vigorous youth, and immortal life? O the bleſſedneſs of that change, when I ſhall be hungry no more; nor have my head diſturbed with the fumes and clouds of food! When all my journeys will be at an end; and I ſhall never loſe nor leave the company I love! When I ſhall neither be croſt by others, nor vext with the violence of my own paſſions! When I ſhall be no more perplext with cares, nor dampt with fears; but dwell ſecure, in aſſured joys, for evermore!</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Joys in the perfection of a glorified body; and of an exalted, inlarged ſpirit! Joys to find my ſelf in the company of thy Saints; and welcomed into the noble ſociety of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels! Joy at the ſight of my deareſt Friends; the greateſt joys in thy preſence, and in the light of thy countenance; from whom I hope for all this joy!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O come, moſt bleſſed Saviour, that we may all be nothing but joy, and love, and peace, without any end. Come, and bring us to our beloved Reſt; and where can our ſouls find any reſt, but in thy boſom? Come that we may reſt from our labours; and where can we lay down our ſelves in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect repoſe, but only in thy love? O come,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50236:128"/>and fill our hearts therewith; that we may hunger and thirſt no more. Come, that we may perfectly know what the new Wine of thy Kingdom is. Come, that we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to feed on nothing elſe; but the ſweeteſt comforts, of ſeeing thy bleſſed face ſmile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on us. And that we may have no other buſineſs, nothing elſe to do, but to enjoy thee in all that we ſee: not ſo much imployment beſides, as to ſpend any time (as now we are forced to do) in wiſhing to enjoy thee.</hi>

                  <p>And yet there is ſtill a greater reaſon remaining, why we ſhould love our Lords appearing; becauſe we ſhall be brought by that to the very top and higheſt pitch of bliſs: which is to SEE GOD (<hi>Matth.</hi> v. 8.) and to SEE HIM AS HE IS, 1 <hi>John</hi> iij. 2. Not as the old Prophets ſaw him in viſions and dreams; nor as others ſaw him, in the Angels of his preſence: But — alas! who can tell what this ſight is? What tongue, unleſs touched, as the Apoſtles were, by the Holy-Ghoſt, can declare any thing of ſuch a bliſs? The
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50236:129"/>day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> muſt return again, if we expect to have any language to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, or thoughts to conceive the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe words. We muſt intreat ſome Angel to come, and tell us, if he can, what it is to <hi>ſee God.</hi> Or rather we muſt confeſs, that, if he ſhould, we cannot underſtand ſuch celeſtial language. It is above our reach; and we do but babble, we do not ſpeak, when we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to diſcourſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Nay, when we depart this world, and ſhall be admitted into the bleſſed compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny above, we may not be able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend much of it; if the opinion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Ancient Fathers be true, that the Saints ſhall not enjoy that which is properly meant by the <hi>Viſion of God,</hi> till after the great day of our Lord. And therefore it will be our beſt way now, to do as the Painter did; who being to make a picture of Love, drew nothing on his Table but a Veil; which covered no body knew what under the ſhadow of it. Not ſo much to ſhow, as ſome have poorly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that Love is blind; as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that it is an ineffable thing, a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious paſſion, not to be deſcribed by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane art. Such, I am ſure, is this <hi>Viſion</hi>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:50236:129"/>of God; and ſuch is the love that it will beget. It is a ſecret never to be known, but by the enjoyment of it: A myſterie reſerved in the holy Place, to be beheld only by entring into it.</p>
                  <p>We have all a natural deſire indeed, to pry into this, as well as all other ſecrets. A ſtrong appetite we find within us, to be admitted into an intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with thoſe things, which are cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lockt up from us. We cannot chuſe but long to go within the Veil; and would fain have the curtain drawn aſide, that the glorious face of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty may appear. But after all our ſearch and buſie enquiry, we are able to ſay no more at preſent but this;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O happy Darkneſs! O bleſſed, O moſt glorious obſcurity! For I do not know what elſe to call thee: How joyful is it to think, that thou art more than we can ask or think? What a pleaſure is it to know, that thou ſurpaſſeſt all that can now be known?

                     <hi>Thou ſhameſt indeed hereby our ſmall underſtanding; but publiſheſt thine own moſt excellent Greatneſs. We are laid very low, when we hear thee ſpeaking thus, at preſent; but it lifts us up and highly exalts us, in our future hopes. We have no means to comprehend this gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; nor know we what to think, when we read theſe words,</hi> you ſhall SEE GOD. <hi>We muſt confeſs our weakneſs, which is abſolutely puzled, with ſo few and ſo plain words.

                     <hi>And till that joyful day ſhall come, ſhine thou, O bleſſed Light, perpetually in theſe eyes.

               <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>Of the mighty power and pleaſure of Love, when it is ſetled in the heart.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AND thus I am come to the end of this other part of my Diſcourſe: Wherein the reaſons of placing our beſt affections on the appearing of Chriſt have been ſo plainly deduced; that, as they cannot but be underſtood, ſo they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but move thoſe hearts, which do not quite turn away their minds from all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of them. And that it ſhould be hard to do, one would think, if we have the leaſt acquaintance with the Chriſtian Religion. Which hereby moſt ſtrongly recommends it ſelf unto us, that it gives us ſuch great and glorious hopes; and entertains our tireſome Pilgrimage with ſuch delightful contemplations, of the joys and pleaſures we ſhall have in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50236:132"/>another world; eſpecially when we come to reſt with our Lord for ever.</p>
               <p>No man that is in his wits, would be without the comfort of this expectation. It far exceeds all our preſent enjoyments: and is in it ſelf ſo deſireable, that we may truly ſay, Faith doth not beg to be admitted by us; but rather commands us to open our hearts and let it in; if we would have any conſtant pleaſure, and ſetled peace and ſatisfaction there, which nothing but the Chriſtian belief can eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh in us. And this is the miſery of all thoſe who do not faithfully receive the Goſpel; that as they ſhall miſs of the greateſt bleſſings hereafter, ſo they want the higheſt comfort in the world at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Which is, to wait with aſſured hope for thoſe good things, which our Lord will give us at his appearing. By the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectance of which, we are not only a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pleaſed while we imploy our minds in ſuch meditations as theſe; but they put us into a ſtate of pleaſure and conſtant ſatisfaction, by drawing our hearts to Heaven, and placing us out of the power, though not out of the reach, of all worldly accidents.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:50236:132"/>
For ſuch is the condition of man, as the Diſciples of <hi>Plato</hi>'s School have well expreſſed it, that there are two effuſions and ecſtaſies, as we may call them, of his ſoul; two ſorts of inebriation (as ſome of them love to ſpeak) whereby he is diſpoſſeſſed of himſelf. By the one (which is a Divine rapture) we are carried out and placed above our ſelves: by the other (which is the witchery of ſenſe) we are hurried away, and thruſt down into a condition below our ſelves. Their meaning is, that man being of a middle nature, between Angels and Beaſts; by his intellectual part partaking of the nature of thoſe heavenly beings, and by his ſenſitive of the nature of the brutes; he may ſo apply himſelf either to the one or to the other, that he come, in great meaſure, out of his middle condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and go either upward to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or downward to the later.</p>
               <p>And this ſtrange feat is wrought by nothing elſe, but by the power of Love; which evidently intrances our ſouls, and tranſports us out of our ſelves: either to the celeſtial natures if it be Divine, or to the brutiſh, if it be founded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the fleſh. By exerciſing our minds
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50236:133"/>in the actions of ſpiritual life, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our affections on things above, we may deliver and infranchiſe our ſelves from a ſervile baſe condition; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nearer to the degree of Angels than of ordinary men. As on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, by applying our minds and hearts wholly to corporeal actions, and addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all our ſervices to the things of this world, we may ſo inthrall our ſelves, and bring our ſouls into ſuch bondage; that we ſhall ſink down into a vile eſtate, and become more like beaſts than men.</p>
               <p>O ſtrange power of Love! which makes ſuch transformations! turning men either into Angels or into the moſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did creatures. How careful ſhould we be to obſerve its motions? What dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhould we uſe, to watch whither it goes; and to ſee that this mighty paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be directed to the moſt excellent good? And if we do but open our eyes to receive the light of the glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and all the beauties that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents unto us, we cannot eaſily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. There are a world of noble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments to which our Saviour invites us; if we will vouchſafe to look upon
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50236:133"/>them, and not be ſo ſottiſh, as to faſten our eyes only on a few objects here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. He hath opened to us the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; and tells us he will ſhow us all the glory of his Fathers houſe; if we will but wait a while, till he be ready to come, and fetch us thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Why ſhould we not believe him, and daily look up unto him; with hearts full of joy that we are beloved of the Lord of life, and have a good hope to live together with him? What a change would this work in us? And how happy ſhould we be, to think of the far more glorious change, which the ſight of him will make; when by ſeeing him, we ſhall become what he is?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O the joy that begins to ſpring up in my heart! O what raviſhing words are thoſe, WE SHALL BE LIKE HIM; FOR WE SHALL SEE HIM AS HE IS? How ſweetly they enter into mine ears? How deliciouſly they ſpread and diffuſe themſelves all over my mind; and ſtrongly penetrate to my very heart? I am changed already. I am not what I was; but quite another man: All
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50236:134"/>light and joy, all ſpirit and life, while I think of theſe things. And can I ever ſo forget them, as to be allured and drawn away, from my ſelf and my Saviour, from my enjoyments and my hopes, by any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What compariſon is there between thoſe two ſtates I now deſcribed, that I ſhould be in danger of ſuch temptations? Is there any need to ask, which is moſt to be choſen? To ſuffer my heart to be touched with ſuch a ſenſe of Divine pleaſures, as to be raviſht out of my ſelf, and become more than man; or to expoſe it ſo to the ſolicitations of ſenſible delights, as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed by them another way out of my ſelf, and transformed into the nature of the beaſts that periſh?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are all deſirous and forward enough to climb higher; and our ambition tempts us to mount to as noble a ſtation, as it is poſſible to reach: And therefore let us aſcend, O my ſoul, to the Lord Jeſus; let us lift up our thoughts ſtill towards the holy place where he reigns; and look for the time of his appearing, to make us reign with him for ever. This is the moſt pleaſant object we can behold; or rather is a coliection of innumerable pleaſures, which
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50236:134"/>all here meet together: and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be of mighty power to raviſh our ſpirits, and ennoble our natures, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them divine. Hither let us vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cheerfully bend our thoughts; let our hearts ſend many and many a wiſh this way; and then it will be as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any thing to hinder us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made heavenly, as it is to keep the ſtone from its centre, or the tendereſt heart from becoming like to that which it dearly loves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here we ſee what God the Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty will do for his Son Jeſus; and what our Lord Jeſus will do for us, who depend upon his Love. We behold our ſelves here ranked among the Heavenly hoſt; changed into ſpirits; made perfect in love; crowned with immortality; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with the light of Divine knowledge and with unſpotted purity of heart; brought into the preſence of our Lord, and unto the ſight of God. On which incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble happineſs while we fix our eyes, it muſt needs ſnatch us quite from all other things; and make us live out of our ſelves. But it will be only to place us above our ſelves; and, by a moſt deſireable departure from what we are, to put us into ſo bleſſed a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50236:135"/>condition, that we ſhall never wiſh to return to our ſelves any more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed the more or leſs our ſouls are drawn forth of themſelves either way, ſo much the harder or eaſier it is to go back into themſelves again. For if we be much raviſhed with theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, if we love the Appearing of Chriſt exceedingly, and attentively fix our minds in expectation of it; we ſhall have little mind to turn our hearts towards corporeal enjoyments, during the ſenſe and lively reliſh of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pleaſures, which have withdrawn us from them. And when the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and neceſſities of our earthly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture call us back again unto them, it will be with a remembrance of thoſe celeſtial joys ſtill remaining; which will preſerve our ſouls from immerſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in things below them. Juſt as when a mans heart is engaged in the ſtricteſt bonds of love, which have tied him faſt to a very agreeable perſon, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever company he comes into, he will ſecretly ſteal out of it, to caſt a glance upon that beloved object: So will our mind be apt to look up towards Heaven (even when we are in the charming
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50236:135"/>ſociety of that perſon) if the Lord and the glory of his appearing be our chiefeſt love and higheſt delight. As on the contrary, if we have but a ſlight touch and taſte of theſe heavenly truths, we ſhall be the eaſier diverted from them; and perſwaded to yield up our ſelves to ſeek our ſatisfaction in the cold enjoyment of theſe earthly delights.</p>
               <p>And thus it is, in like manner, when men follow brutal pleaſures; the more ſtrongly they are raviſht with them and addict themſelves to them; the more they loſe the uſe of their reaſon and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and the more uncapable they grow, being ſo attentive to theſe delights, to receive any guſt of nobler enjoyments. Whereas, if our taſte of theſe things be more ſuperficial, and we do not apply our minds with all their force unto them, nor dwell upon them; we ſhall be the eaſier called off from them, and ſtand in need of fewer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to quit their company, for better entertainments.</p>
               <p>Which demonſtrates how neceſſary it is, that we ſhould indeavour to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the coming of our Lord; to believe it with an unſhaken faith; to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50236:136"/>perſwade our ſelves of it, as if we ſaw it; to ſet our hearts upon it, and place our comforts in it; that ſo it may have the greater authority over us, and command us irreſiſtibly from all things beneath us, and force us to give our ſelves intirely to our Lord Jeſus.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>Of the means whereby this Love may be ſetled in our hearts; and the Benefit thereof.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AND for the better effecting this which ſo nearly concerns us, we ought, as to think frequently and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of it ſo, to uſe all the means that are in our power, to repreſent our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord and his glorious Appearing, in the moſt lively manner unto our hearts. Among which, I believe, you will find none more effectual, than to frequent his ſociety, in the Communion of his Body and of his Blood. Where we not only meet with a fair occaſion, both to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print upon our hearts a ſenſe of his love, and to expreſs all the love we have to him: but have a moſt powerful inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo put into our hands, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle and ſtir up the moſt hearty, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50236:137"/>and burning Affection towards him.</p>
               <p>For there he is ſet before our eyes in ſuch a poſture of love, as cannot but wound any heart, that hath the grace to conſider what it ſees. There we behold him hanging for our ſake upon a Croſs; from whence his mighty love ſhoots the moſt piercing darts into our breaſts. We ſee him there in ſuch flames as offered him up intirely to do the will of God; and, if we come near them, will touch us ſo ſenſibly, that we ſhall be diſpoſed to make our ſelves alſo a devout oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him. His Body broken, his Blood ſhed, his very Life ſacrificed for our ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are there ſo evidently and diſtinctly ſet before our eyes; that as it will be hard for us not to be tenderly affected with his aſtoniſhing love to us, ſo we are hereby aſſured of his continued kindneſs, till he bring us to eternal life.</p>
               <p>We do not indeed behold him there as ſitting on the throne of his glory; nor as appearing again the ſecond time to give us ſalvation: But yet it plainly ſhows us what he underwent, to purchaſe for us as well as for himſelf that glory wherein he is; and bids us reſt ſatisfied
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50236:137"/>he will do more for us, even all that he hath promiſed: of which, by theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and pledges of his love, which he hath left behind him when he departed this world, he doth moſt affectionately aſſure us. And by partaking of them, we become alſo one body with him; and have communion with him in his death and paſſion, and all the benefits he hath thereby obtained for his Church. Among which this is the laſt and the greateſt, that we ſhall be with him where he is, and ſee the glory which the Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him. We ought not to doubt of it, being thus incorporate with him, and ſo united to him; that in him we already live, and reign, and are glorious: and can no more fail of appearing at laſt with him in his glory, than the Members can fail to be advanced, when the Head, to which they are firmly and inſeparably joyned, is highly honoured and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>As a loving Wife therefore, married to an Husband moſt completely qualified, but gone into a remote country, cannot but fix her thoughts very much upon his coming, and often wiſh for the happy day which will bring them nearer, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50236:138"/>make them meet and live together; and, in the mean time, if ſhe have his picture exactly taken, cannot refrain from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often on it, and pleaſing her eyes and her mind with the very ſhadow of that dear Perſon; or if ſhe have any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his love left or ſent her, whereby to remember him, is ever and anon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it into her hands, and imprinting her kiſſes on it: ſo it becomes all thoſe to do, who pretend any love to our Lord Jeſus; who hath endeared himſelf to us by ſuch incomparable loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and merited ſo highly of us, that it would be exceeding ſtrange if we ſhould be either inſenſible of his favours, or let them ſlip out of our minds, when (among the reſt of the expreſſions of his wonderful love) he hath taken great care to preſerve the remembrance of them there.</p>
               <p>Our gracious Lord, the Bridegroom of our ſouls, is gone a long journey, even as far as Heaven. He hath eſpouſed us to himſelf, it is true, in great love, moſt aſſured love; but hath left us, for a time, here in this world, and removed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo far from us, that, though there be nothing ſo deſireable as his company,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50236:138"/>to thoſe who are acquainted with him and have any affection for him, yet they find the diſtance is ſo exceeding great between them, that they cannot attain their much wiſht for enjoyment of him. And therefore every good ſoul ſhould look towards him and, ſighing within it ſelf, ſhould often ſay, <hi>When will he come, when will he come! and let me have the long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſight of him? When will he come, and finiſh what he hath ſo graciouſly begun? O that he would come, and take me to him! O that he would come, and ſatisfie this ſoul; which is ready to diſſolve, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly melt into that bliſsful union with him!</hi> And till he pleaſe to grant this deſire, we ſhould often faſten our expecting eyes on the Picture he hath left us of himſelf; drawn, as I may ſay, by his own hand: which tells us he will certainly come, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to reſt aſſured he will be as good as his word, and give us immortal life in the glory where he is. We ſhould fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, I mean, the holy Sacrament of his body and blood; we ſhould love there to communicate with him and knit our ſelves to him; it ſhould be our greateſt pleaſure to ſolace our ſelves in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of him, till he comes. We
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50236:139"/>ſhould affectionately receive into our hands thoſe tokens and pledges of his love, which he continually ſends us by his Miniſters; we ſhould take them into our mouths, yea let them into our hearts; and, embracing him in thoſe ſigns and ſeals of his grace towards us, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his love; till he himſelf appear, and lay our ſouls to reſt in his boſom for ever.</p>
               <p>If there were no other benefit we ſhould receive by this means, than that thereby our love will be mightily excited towards him, who hath loved us ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it were ſufficient to commend this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to us. But we ſhall alſo grow thereby more confident of his appearing again to perfect his love towards us; and in the mean time be ſtill receiving freſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of the affection he now hath for us. For as the thoughts of his love hath the greateſt power over our hearts: ſo we need not fear to ſay, that the love he ſees in us, is of ſuch force and efficacy with him; that it ſtrongly moves his tender compaſſions towards us. <hi>If any man love me</hi> (ſaith he himſelf xiv. <hi>Joh.</hi> 21, 23.) <hi>he ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifeſt my
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50236:139"/>ſelf to him.</hi> O, what a word is this, <hi>I will love him?</hi> How it pierces into the heart! How it ſtirs, and works; how it revives and refreſhes there! Can there be any thing greater than this, to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Lord of Heaven, the Prince of Life, the King of Glory? What will not he do for thoſe whom he loves, when we ſee he did not ſtick to dye for them, even before they loved him?</p>
               <p>You know that when <hi>Lazarus</hi> was ſick (as I think I have ſomewhere obſerved in another Treatiſe) his Siſters ſent this news to our Saviour, ſaying; <hi>Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he whom thou loveſt is ſick,</hi> xi. Joh. 3. This was a very ſhort Letter: And their grief perhaps would not permit them to write a longer. But they did not fare the worſe, becauſe they were not more ceremonious in their addreſſes: this alone did the buſineſs. O how great a power was there in theſe few words? They ſay no more to move him, but only this, <hi>Lord, thou loveſt him;</hi> and what doth not our Saviour do, to ſhow they were not miſtaken? Up he riſes; away he goes to the place of his abode; there needed no more prayers to bring him thither. And though there were many dangers in the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50236:140"/>way, as the ſtory relates; though to go thither, his Diſciples thought was to caſt himſelf into a ſhowr of ſtones (v. 8.) though the Jews, he knew very well, ſought to take him and kill him (x. 39.) yet love being as ſtrong as death, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him through all impediments: He could not chuſe but go, when he heard this charming word, he <hi>whom thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt</hi> is ſick.</p>
               <p>By which we may learn that to obtain the favour and grace, the help and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the comfort and the preſence of our bleſſed Saviour, we need no long Petitions, no great addreſs of words, no courtſhip, nor ſtudied complements. Let us be able only to tell him, that he loves us; and it is enough. If we can but win his good affection, we need no more. We may then remember to him his own dear love, more than ours. We may tell him, how much good he hath done us, and that is argument ſufficient to move him to do more.</p>
               <p>We may relate his graciouſneſs and ſweet diſpoſition; when we can perceive in our own hearts, but diſguſts at our ſelves. We may ſay, O my Lord, I have ſeen by many arguments the wonderful
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50236:140"/>great good will thou beareſt to me. For thou haſt inſtructed my ignorance, piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my weakneſſes, cured many of my diſeaſes, delivered me from the power of temptations; I cannot tell what thou haſt done for me, O moſt merciful Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who art ſtill going on, by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ways, to teſtifie thou loveſt me. And this humble devout acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will certainly invite a further effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his favours. For it is a pleaſure to him to do benefits; eſpecially to thoſe he loves. He rejoyces over them to do them good. He loves to accompliſh his own good purpoſes, and delights, as much as they can deſire, to perfect what he hath happily begun in them. And therefore we may intreat him to give himſelf that pleaſure; not to loſe any of that joy, which will ſo much pleaſe and rejoyce us alſo; and make us his debtors, his admirers, his adorers, and lovers to all eternity.</p>
               <p>We may deſire him, even that it would pleaſe him to come again, according to his promiſe; becauſe he loves us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loves to finiſh his works of love: and we may be confident he will, and bring his rewards with him. Though he
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50236:141"/>ſtay, we think, a great while (for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reaſons which he beſt knows) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he come; as he ſtayed two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he heard of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his ſickneſs, (notwithſtanding the love he had for him, and his intentions to reſcue him from death:) yet we ought not to be diſcouraged, if we be ſure he loves us; but believe that he will appear at laſt, and that he will raiſe us up, though we lye dead in our graves, and have lain ſo perhaps many years, and that he will bid us come forth, and go along with him, whither his endleſs love will lead us.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HAve we not great reaſon then to love him, and to love his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſince that will be the beſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his love to us; and his love, you ſee, will prove ſuch an aſſurance of all his bleſſings? What will move us, if this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it? Need there any thing more be ſaid, to draw our affections towards him? If there do, then let me aſſure you that love will even transform us into him.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more diſcernible in this paſſion, than that it aſſimilates us unto the Thing or Perſon which we love.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50236:142"/>Which ſhould teach us indeed to have a great care what and whom we love; but ſhould excite us to love him, our Deareſt Lord, without any meaſure: Becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo deſireable as to be like to him; and nothing can prepare us ſo ſurely for his glorious appearing. <hi>In that which every man loves, in that he lives,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon thoſe words of the great Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul. [not I live, but Chriſt liveth in me.]</hi> So great, ſo mighty a thing is true love; that it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the heart from the place where it is, and tranſlates it thither where it loves. If thou loveſt thy ſelf merely, then thou liveſt altogether in thy ſelf: But if thy heart be ſet on any other perſon or thing, then thou liveſt in that which hath ingaged thy affection: And if it be Jeſus whom thou loveſt in ſincerity, it is certain that in him alſo thou liveſt.</p>
               <p>Of ſo great importance it is, that we love aright: For he that loves ill, lives ill; and he that loves well, cannot but live well too. But there is no danger at all in loving our Lord and his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and therefore we need not ſtand to ask our ſelves whether we ſhould love
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50236:142"/>him or no; or how much we ſhall love him; or with what paſſion and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſhould ſet our hearts upon his coming again, to take us into his glory. There is nothing to hinder us, from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving here as much as ever we are able; no fear our affections ſhould be too far ingaged, as they may be in other caſes; all that caution is uſeleſs here, which, when we are in purſuit of leſſer injoyments, is but neceſſary, to put a check upon our hearts, and cool a little our love towards them. The more we love him, the more we ſhall be like him; the more we love him, the more we ſhall live in him. This love makes us divine and heavenly; it puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us, and makes us fit to live with him.</p>
               <p>I muſt add alſo that, according to this rule, by <hi>loving his appearing,</hi> we ſhall be formed to ſome likeneſs of it; as much as we are capable here to be wrought and faſhioned to an imitation of a thing ſo bright and full of glory. It will raiſe our minds that is, to a noble pitch; and highly improve our degenerate nature. It will invite him to manifeſt himſelf to us, and graciouſly to ſhine upon us. It will poſſeſs us with a lively ſenſe of him, and of the glory wherein he lives. The
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50236:143"/>light of his countenance will be lifted up on our ſouls; and he will fill us with a ſtronger ſenſe of life and immortality. It will chaſe away the baſe fear of death; and kill all vitious affections in us. We ſhall be purified, and refined from all our droſs, by theſe holy fires. There is no ſin will be able to live in the ſame place with this heavenly love; but will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually languiſh and decay, as this increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and grows ſtronger in our ſouls. Our ſpirits thereby will become more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, light and aerial. They will aſcend more eaſily towards thoſe celeſtial places; and be leſs inclined, though they feel its attractions, toward this lower world. O what a Coronet of Glory, will this love place before-hand on our head! It is it ſelf a royal ornament, and a diadem of glory. It's a participation of a Divine Nature, an entrance upon the life of God, an Heaven upon earth, a pleaſure whereby we anticipate the joys of the other world: for if all love have a ſweetneſs in it, this Divine love ſure cannot but entertain us with a tranſcendent ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>By this we have our converſation in Heaven; and it is there only to be <hi>ever with the Lord</hi> (as much as our condition
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50236:143"/>here will give us leave) for nothing but love will make him familiar to our thoughts, and preſent him frequently to the eye of our minds. Yea, this is the beſt glaſs we have, while we are here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, wherein to <hi>ſee God.</hi> If there be any way to know the meaning of thoſe words, we muſt learn it of this Teacher; which alone can diſcover to us ſo great a myſterie. Nothing elſe can lead us into that ſecrecy, and reveal to us what lies hid in that retirement, <hi>the Viſion of God.</hi> Never hope for any key to open a door into the Holy of Holies; unleſs it be this of heavenly love. If it be poſſible to peep a little behind the veil; it is love only that enjoys ſo ſingular a priviledge. For God, you ſee, is love: and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, that when Faith and Hope ſhall be done away, it is charity alone that ſtill remains; as a thing of longer duration than this world, and whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place is Heaven. This is one of the Cherubims of Glory, that inhabits the moſt holy place, and attends upon the Majeſty on high. This is of an Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Nature, and is always there where God is. It waits upon him; it miniſters to him; it knows his mind; it is privy
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50236:144"/>to his thoughts and deſigns; and makes us underſtand more of him, than all the wit in the world can do beſide.</p>
               <p>There is nothing can lend wings to the ſoul, but only love: which raiſes us above this world, and ſets us in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of him that made it. And what a ſight doth it give us there, of his bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, bottomleſs Goodneſs? If it can ſhow us nothing elſe, it will not fail to let us ſee how gracious, how wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gracious the Lord is. With what kindneſs doth love behold almighty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, ſpreading it ſelf in tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy over all its works? It is this alone can make us feel how inclinable the Divine Nature is, to pour out its Benefits. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but love can make us know what an everlaſting ſpring it is of grace and bounty; and with what unwearied kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it delights to communicate its bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to us. And what is there that we would ſee, which is comparable to this? What can we deſire to ſee, but more of this; even when we are made perfect in love? And what thanks do we owe to God that we ſee ſo much? It ought to ſtir up all that is within us, to bleſs his holy name. We ought to ſay; <hi>every
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50236:144"/>day will I bleſs thee, and praiſe thy name for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for this alſo we muſt be beholden to love. For it is that which indites all our Hymns, and meditates the Divine Praiſes. It puts the ſongs of joy into our mouth; and fills our hearts with thankſgiving. Our tongues are tyed without this; or we do but babble, not ſpeak, our Saviours praiſes.</p>
               <p>It is love that burſts out into ſuch effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as theſe;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O praiſe the Lord of love, who humbled himſelf do dwell among us. Praiſe him in the beauties of his holineſs; praiſe him in his ſuper-excellent wiſdom. Let all his works praiſe him; who came to us with his hands full of Miracles, and every miracle full of mercy. O praiſe him in his almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and moſt merciful kindneſs; which made the lame to leap like a Kid, and the tongue of the dumb to ſing for joy: which opened the eyes of the blind to ſee his wonders; and the ears of the deaf to hear the wiſdom where by he ſpake: which reſtored the ſick to health, and the dead to life: which pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the Goſpel to the poor, and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:50236:145"/>the ignorant in the myſteries of the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O praiſe him, before whom the Devils fled, and confeſſed him to be the Lord. Praiſe him in his incomparable love; which thought it not enough to do all this, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo gave himſelf to dye for us. Let all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions praiſe him, who are the purchaſe of his blood. Let them mark every ſtep of his dying love; from the time he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed and ſold like a ſlave, till he finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſufferings on the Croſs. O the greatneſs of that love, which endured ſuch ſcorn, ſuch reproach, ſuch a bitter agony and ſhameful death, even for all thoſe who have little ſenſe of this wondrous love!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let no Chriſtian ſoul be inſenſible, how the hands which wrought ſo many Miracles, and the feet which travelled up and down to do men good, were cruelly nailed by them to an ignominious Gibbet. Let them remember how his head was crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thorns, and his body cloathed in a fools coat. How they ſpit in his face, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his eyes, and then rudely buffeted him to make them ſport. O what love was that, which made him ſubmit to be mocked and reviled, to be accounted worſe than a ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious murderer, and numbred among the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50236:145"/>greateſt tranſgreſſors! And above all, let it never be forgotten how he ſweat in our ſervice, as it had been drops of blood; and at laſt bled to death, after three hours ſhame and anguiſh on the Croſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Praiſed be that incomparable Charity. Praiſed be his inimitable meekneſs and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie. Let all the world extol and praiſe his Lamb-like patience and innocence. Let them celebrate his admirable kindneſs in forgiving ſuch implacable enemies; and his intire confidence and faith in God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he offered up himſelf to him, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an eternal redemption for us. O the wonderful vertue of that ſacrifice, which hath taken away the ſins of the world! Praiſed be the tender mercies of our God, which have forgiven us ſo many treſpaſſes. Praiſed be his mercies, which have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgiven us; but reſtored us to life and glory again, by the reſurrection of Jeſus from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us rejoyce and be glad in that great ſalvation. Let us bleſs the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by that reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his from the dead. Let us lift up our heads and look to Heaven our ancient
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50236:146"/>Country, for there he is exalted: And let us thank our God, who hath ſet him at his own right hand, and made him moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>See how all the Angels welcomed him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and falling at his feet, moſt humbly worſhipped his Majeſty. See how they all now wait upon him, and conſtantly attend his pleaſure. And let us worſhip him too, with the devouteſt and moſt lowly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Let us praiſe him in his Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: where he appears before God for us; from whence he ſends down the gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of his ſpirit on us; and commands his Angels to miniſter unto us. Let us praiſe him, the glorious King of Angels and men. Who hath conquered death; and triumphed over all the powers of darkneſs; and opening the Kingdom of Heaven to all the faithful, hath promiſed that they ſhall reign in glory together with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let all the Angelical Miniſters praiſe him. Let the Apoſtles, Prophets and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs praiſe him. Let all thoſe who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in the true faith and fear of him, praiſe him. And let all the living, who partake of the daily fruit of his bounteous love, continually praiſe him. Let them praiſe the name of the Lord: for his name
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50236:146"/>alone is excellent, his glory is above the Earth and Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let them praiſe him in the greatneſs of his Power, in the Wiſdom of his Counſels, in the carefulneſs of his Providence, in the riches, the exceeding riches of his Grace, in the ſtedfaſtneſs of his word, and the faithfulneſs of all his promiſes. And let them all joyn together and beſeech him to come again; that he may both accompliſh our hopes, and perfect his own praiſes.</hi>
               </p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>More expreſſions of this devout af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, towards our Lords Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing; and the way whereby we may excite them.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis is ſome of the language of Love; which wiſhes every knee would bow to Jeſus, and every tongue confeſs that he is the Lord; to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God the Father, who hath thus highly exalted him. For its deſires are unlimited; and its kindneſs, like the fountain of it, is inexhauſtible and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. It is the brighteſt image of Jeſus. There is nothing repreſents him ſo lively to the world. He now appears moſt in thoſe who love moſt; and who long and wait with pure and ardent deſires to ſee him come in all his glory. For they will <hi>keep his commandment without ſpot, unrebukeable, until his appearing: which
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:50236:147"/>in his times he will ſhew, who is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, who only hath immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee; to whom be honour and power everlaſting.</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why then, O my ſoul, do we not let this bleſſed gueſt be lodged in our heart? Or why do we not entertain it ſo that it may ſtay with us; and we may feel it ſtirring there in reſtleſs motions towards Jeſus? What is the cauſe that we who are made to love, ſhould not let our love turn divine; and addreſs it moſt devoutly to him, who beſt deſerves the Love of all the world? Or what may it be, that keeps us from running with the whole current of our affections, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that heavenly Lover; who ſues ſo earneſtly to us for our hearty love? Hath he not loved us enough to make us love him? Was he a cold and indifferent Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that could not touch the heart with a ſenſe of his kindneſs? Was he perfectly fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and careleſs in our concerns, when the urgent wants of our ſouls, called for his kind and compaſſionate relief? Or did he
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50236:148"/>pretend a great deal of kindneſs, and made long proteſtations of his love; but did juſt nothing to merit our affection?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There need no anſwer to ſuch queſtions; which ſerve only to reproach and confound our inſenſibleneſs and negligence; who have nothing to ſay, why we do not love him. For ſo apparent is his love, ſo confeſſedly great, ſo coſtly and expenſive, ſo tender and obliging; that as it had no example, nor can be ever exactly imitated; ſo it muſt needs attract all thoſe and fill them with the greateſt love, who do not turn away their eyes, and their ears, and their hearts from this Lord of love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us but liſten a while to him, and we ſhall hear him ſay; was there any love like unto my love? What is it that you would have had me done for you, more than I have done (without your deſire) to win your love? Hath any man greater love than this, that he lay down his life for his Friends?. But what were you, for whom I died? Herein God commended his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, in that while you were yet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, I dyed for you. And what was the purchaſe I made by that price, which I laid down for you? Who is it that hath the keys of Hell and death? To whom is all
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:50236:148"/>power given in Heaven and in Earth? Can any but I forgive your ſins; and open to you the Kingdom of Heaven; and reſtore you to the joys of Paradiſe; nay, make you eat of the tree of life in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where do you read of any King, who, at his Coronation, gave ſuch royal gifts to men? From whom do you expect the Crown of righteouſneſs, and an eternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; of which I gave the earneſt ſo long ago? Can you think of any thing compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the glory of my appearing? Or is there any doubt whether I will come or no; or whether you ſhall appear with me in that celeſtial glory? What would you have me do to ſatisfie and aſſure you, more than I have already done; by my Word, and by my Blood, and by my Angels, and by my Holy Spirit; which I have ſent down from Heaven to bear witneſs to me, and to tell you that I will certainly come again, and give you the Kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world? Believe it, I will as ſurely come again, as I died; and roſe from the dead; and viſibly aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Heaven; and according to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe poured out the Holy-Ghoſt upon my Apoſtles, and inſpired them to proclaim
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50236:149"/>this in all tongues and languages; that I ſtill live; and that, becauſe I live, you ſhall live alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is it poſſible for us to think we hear him ſpeaking to us in this manner (as he doth in his bleſſed Goſpel) and not be provoked to ſummon all the powers of our ſoul, to offer up themſelves in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and hearty love to him? What hath the deareſt friend, whom we love with ſo much paſſion; nay, even our tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Parents done for us, in compariſon with this love? Or what can the favour of all the Princes on earth (ſhould they unite all their powers to love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour us) beſtow and heap upon us, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be named together with this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous love? It ought to call us from all vain delights. Our minds ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſtudy to comprehend the breadth and length, the depth and height: and to know the love of Chriſt; which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth knowledge. Our wills ought to be more paſſionately bent towards him; and grow every day ſtronger in his love. Our memories ſhould be a moſt faithful Treaſury of the manifold tokens of his Love. Our tongues and our hearts ſhould never ceaſe to meditate and ſing the praiſes of his wondrous love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:50236:149"/>
For if we could ſpeak to him (as we may conceive him ſpeaking to us) and ask him what he did before the world; he would tell us that, <hi>He loved.</hi> If we could ask him what moved his Almighty Wiſdom to make the world; he would tell you that <hi>he loved.</hi> If we could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ask what he hath done ever ſince; he would ſtill ſay, <hi>he loved.</hi> And what brought him down from Heaven (if we could ask again) to be partaker of our miſeries; he would tell you again that <hi>he loved.</hi> And could we ask again why he would humble himſelf ſo low as to take the form a ſervant, and dye a baſe, ſervile and ignominious death, the death of the Croſs, he would again tell you, that <hi>he loved.</hi> And if you could ſtill go on to ask what moved him to ſend the Holy Ghoſt and give ſuch gifts to men; you would ſtill receive the ſame anſwer, becauſe <hi>he loved.</hi> And could you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him not to be angry and you would inquire again, what he hath been doing ſince thoſe days, and what he now does; he would give you no new anſwer, but that <hi>he loves.</hi> And if you ſhould pray him once more to tell you <hi>what he loves;</hi> he would let you know, it is nothing but <hi>love, abundance of love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:50236:150"/>
This is the thing he would win by his love. This is all that he asks and deſires at our hands; though he hath obliged us ſo much. For this he ſolicites and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeches; having ſet his heart upon it, as the fruit of his incomparable love. He intreats for this, as if it were for his life, that we would be at laſt ſo ſenſible of all his kindneſs, as to let him have our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned love. For he being Love himſelf, loves nothing elſe but ſincere and hearty love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O bleſſed Jeſus,</hi> ſhould all our hearts then ſay, <hi>how much doth thy love differ from ours! Love brought thee down from Heaven to us; but how few of us (and how ſlowly) doth it carry up thither unto thee? Love made thee dye the moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death; but it doth not make us live the moſt glorious life. It made thee endure the ſoreſt pains; but, alas! it doth not make mankind take the pleaſure of following thy ſteps to the greateſt happineſs. It made thee think perpetually on ſuch poor wretches as we are; but how ſeldom are our minds fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or how ſmall is the number whom love inclines to think, upon ſo glorious a perſon as thy ſelf?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:50236:150"/>
                  <hi>It perſwaded thee to come to us, when there was nothing to call thee but only our great miſeries; but it doth not bring us all to thee, when we are moved by the merits, and the pretious promiſes of ſo great a love. Thy Preaching was Love, thy Miracles were love, thy whole Life was love, thy Death was the moſt ſingular love, thy laſt breath, in a manner, was love, one of thy laſt words was love, even to the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt enemies, thy Sacraments are love, the Holy-Ghoſt the Comforter is love, thy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors were love, thou art, we ſee All love; and yet, dull and ſtupid blocks that we are, we are nothing leſs than this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O ſweet Saviour, what wilt thou do with ſuch vile, ſuch wretched hearts, as theſe of ours? Canſt thou endure ſo much as to look upon ſuch ſouls, as are ſo frozen before thy fires? Canſt thou ſhed one beam more upon ſuch icy hearts, that are ſo inſenſible of all thy flames? Is it poſſible that thou ſhouldeſt be ſo patient, as to bear with the prayers of thoſe, whoſe breaſts are ſo full of love, ſo propenſe to this affection, ſo free to pour it out to every thing; and yet allow ſo few or no drops of it unto thee, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveſt all the love we have?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:50236:151"/>
                  <hi>O Deareſt Lord, if there be any room ſtill left in thy heart for ſuch as we are, be pleaſed once more to caſt thine eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us moſt miſerable ſinners. If thou canſt lend thine ears to the requeſts of ſuch fooliſh, ſuch obſtinate hearts, as have been ſo ſenſleſly deaf to all thy gracious intreaties; hear the ſighs and the groans of all thoſe penitent ſouls who cry unto thee and ſay, Lord Jeſus look upon us. Spare us, Good Lord, if it be but one dram of thy pity and tendereſt compaſſion. O ſpare us but the leaſt touch more from thine all-powerful hand; if thou art not weary of ſtriking ſuch rocky hearts, as now petition thee for thy love. O mollifie them, moſt gracious Lord, mollifie them, we beſeech thee, with thy Dear love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. Now that they are a little ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and yielding to thee, melt and diſſolve them into the like love towards thee. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into all our hearts; O that thou wouldſt enter, and fill them with thy love. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them with this powerful engine, thy mighty, thy wonderful Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy love, I ſay, thy moſt ſtupendious love; for no word pleaſes me ſo much as love. Give me leave therefore to repeat it over again, and to pray thee by thy love,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50236:151"/>by thy dear and tender love, that thou wilt not paſs by this heart of mine (among all the reſt) which now at laſt would fain be repleniſhed with thy love. I lye here in the humbleſt devotion proſtrate at thy feet, and, gaſping there before thee, my ſoul pants and ſays; O Love, inſpire me: O Love, breath thy ſoul and life into me. As thou haſt overcome, ſo poſſeſs this heart intirely, and vouchſafe to dwell in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And do thou, my incomprehenſibly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Saviour, make me ever thus to ſigh and groan, out of the very center of mine heart, after thee. Make me always to be ſaying thus to thee; O my life, my joy, my hope, my all, do not deſpiſe this languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul, which intreats thee to dwell in it, by thy ſurpaſſing love. Draw me after thee, and touch me ſo, that I may look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing ſo much as thy love. Turn my heart about; and bend it wholly to thy love. Make me to ſpeak of nothing, with ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, as of thy love: to breath nothing, to ſtudy nothing, to deſire, to do nothing, but only love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let no day, at leaſt, paſs without ſome ſerious meditations of thy love. Let no Sun ſhine, but what ſhows me thee and thy love, ſhining brighter by far upon me.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50236:152"/>Let no night cloſe mine eyes, but do thou ſhut up a ſenſe of thy ſelf and thy love in my breaſt. Let no friend come to viſit me, but give him thy love to bring along with him; and let him preſent thy ſelf unto me. Let the ſight of him, enkindle thy love in me. Let the embraces of him, knit me in faſter affection to thee. Let the remembrance of him and his kindneſs, recall to mind thy infinitely greater love to me. Let every motion of my heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, reſt at laſt in the love of thee: who art the hope and the ſatisfaction both of him and me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Still may I therefore think of thee more frequently. Still may I deſire thee more paſſionately. Still may I obey the more univerſally. May the following acts of love and vertue, ſtill out-ſtrip the former: and one conqueſt of my ſelf, make way for a nobler. May thine Almighty love ſtill grow and prevail; till there be no affection that dare appear, no paſſion that dare preſume to ſhow its head, againſt the ſoveraign power of thy love in mine heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now, O my Lord, I know not how to leave thee, untill I hear thee ſay, Thou loveſt me. Proſtrate ſtill will I here lye
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50236:152"/>at thy feet, for I cannot have the heart to riſe up again; unleſs thou wilt ſpeak that kind, that gracious word, and tell me, that thou doſt not ceaſe to love me. Nay, I dye unleſs thou loveſt me. I ſhall make my grave here in this very place; and expire with theſe words in my mouth; LORD WHETHER I LIVE OR DYE IT MATTERS NOT; LET ME B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T KNOW THAT THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> LOVEST ME.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And may I be ſo bold as to conclude thou haſt ſome love to me, becauſe I feel my heart beat thus paſſionately towards thee, and my ſoul thirſts and cryes thus after thee? Will it not be too great a preſumption to think thou haſt not forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me, becauſe I cannot forſake my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; but above all things long and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be beloved of thee? Is this love thou haſt wrought in my heart to thee, an incouragement to hope thou loveſt me? Truly then, my Lord, I am well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Then I know thou beareſt a favour to me. For my ſoul follows hard af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee; it cleaves unto thee; it loves thy memory; and delights it ſelf in thy Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:50236:153"/>
                  <hi>It ſayes continually, nothing but more of thy love; nothing, but abundance of thy love. I open my heart unto thy exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant love. I expoſe my ſelf to the power of thy tranſcendent love. I chuſe and deſire the pleaſures of thy love; above all the delights, wherewith the world can entertain me. Above the admired heaps of wealth, and the dazling heights of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Above the loudeſt praiſes of fame, and the bewitching applauſe of numerous ſpectators. Above the charms of beauty, and the more inticing delights of curious knowledge. Nay, above the ſolid joyes of health, and the moſt neceſſary refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature. Above all, that even thine own bounty can give, to thoſe that love thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O let me but love thee; make me but always thus to love thee; alwayes deſpiſe all other delights, compared with thoſe of loving thee; do but fill my heart with that love and with thoſe delights: and I am perfectly ſatisfied. I am at reſt now I have given my ſelf to thee intirely. And if I had a thouſand hearts, they ſhould be devoted to thy ſervice, with the moſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate love to thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:50236:153"/>
                  <hi>But yet, alas! when I think of thy wondrous love, I am apt to conclude again that I did amiſs to ſay, I was ſatisfied. All this, upon better thoughts, ſeems a great deal too little; and I am as ſhort, me thinks, of thy love, as if I loved thee not at all. For what have I given thee, when I have paid thee all my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements? What have I beſtowed on thee, when I have given thee my ſelf, and abſolutely offered all my affections to thee? What is my heart, what are a thouſand ſuch hearts as this worth; that I ſhould think ſuch a preſent will be of any eſteem with thee? If all my life were nothing elſe, but the moſt affectionate, the moſt cheerful obedience to thee; what requital ſhould I have made thee for all thy love to me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas! I have ſo little ability to do any thing worthy of thee; that I have not the skill how to ſpeak, as becomes me, of my duty to thee. What do I talk of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements to thee? That's as if I could number or value thy favours. And it is a worſe abſurdity to ſpeak of giving thee my affections (as if I were not a debtor to thee) and of beſtowing my heart on thee; For that's as if I had any thing
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50236:154"/>I received not from thee. But it is worſt of all (I am aſhamed of it) to mention a requital of thy favours; for that's as if they were ſo ſmall or ſo few, as to admit of any return like a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No, No, I am nothing at all. I have nothing, I can do juſt nothing, but what is thine more than mine; if it be worth any thing. I here moſt ſolemnly proteſt that I think my ſelf indebted to thee, for all I have. I my ſelf am thine; my love is thine; my prayers and deſires are thine; my praiſes and thanksgivings are thine; ſo is my Faith and my Hope, my comforts and my joyes, they are all thine. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as confeſs my debts and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations; but it is from thee. I cannot be ſenſible of my faults; but I contract a new debt to thee. That I can ſo much as ſee and ſay, I am nothing, I owe it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ſhall I do therefore? How ſhall I expreſs my ſelf to thee? Or in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall I approach thee? All that I can think of is only this; ſtill to caſt down my ſelf in the humbleſt devotion before thee, and all thawed and diſſolved with thy love to pour out my heart unto thee,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50236:154"/>ſaying; LORD, WORK THINE OWN GOOD PLEAS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE IN ME. Make me what thou thy ſelf beſt likeſt and loveſt. And when thou haſt loved and obliged me as much as thou pleaſeſt here; compleat thine own benefits and crown them with as great a glory, as thine own great love can beſtow hereafter.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>AND here I think it is beſt to put a period to this diſcourſe; which is already come to a competent length. For where can I leave you better than in the arms of our Lord; intirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into his will, and wiſhing to be united to him, and made one ſpirit with him, as much as he pleaſes? And yet how hard is it to ceaſe to deſire that happineſs, in its utmoſt perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? How can we chuſe but ask him leave, at leaſt to repete that wiſh over again? The very thoughts of it make the raviſhed ſoul, thruſt it ſelf with the more ardent affection into the boſom of his love. They ſtir it up to ply him with new petitions, that he will draw it more ſtrongly after him, and knit it more cloſely to him; that he will inſpire
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50236:155"/>it with more of his love, and, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting his likeneſs in it, inſeparably unite it to himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O bleſſed Jeſus, ſurely thou wilt appear: I believe in due time thou wilt appear. I am fully perſwaded thou wilt not fail to make good thy word; of coming to fetch us to thy ſelf, and making us exceedingly more happy than now, in our moſt inlarged thoughts, we can conceive. I ſee, me thinks, the sky cleave, and the day break, and the Arch-angel, thy Harbinger, begin to look forth and thruſt his head out of the clouds: which makes my heart leap for joy; as if it would leave this world, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly go to meet thee, my infinitely Dearer Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For what ſplendor is there in Gold,
<note place="margin">Greg. Nyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. Orat. V. in Beatitud.</note> that I ſhould deſire it? What brightneſs in pretious ſtones? What ornament in the moſt ſumptuous apparel, compared with that Good which our hope in thee ſuppoſes, and ſets before us? When thou who reigneſt over all creatures, ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal thy ſelf to mankind, ſitting moſt magnificently upon a lofty Throne; when innumerable millions of Angels
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:50236:156"/>ſhall be ſeen about thee; and when the Kingdom of Heaven, which now is ſuch a ſecret, ſhall be ſet wide open before all our eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O let the thoughts of the Trump of God, which ſhall then ſound, awaken my ſoul more powerfully, to lift up it ſelf to look for thee; and for that glorious ſight, thou wilt bleſs us withal, at thy appearing! O let the faith that is in thy heart grow dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more active, and work in me a moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous love of thee! And let my love be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, till this heart be ſtretched to its utmoſt capacity; and thou, the infinite Good, ſtill fill and overflow it. For I am afraid thou ſhouldeſt come and find me unprepared for thee. I would not for all the world be found unready to meet thee; and unfit for the bleſſings thou wilt bring along with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If an heart that deſires thee moſt paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately be of any worth; if thou canſt have any kind thoughts of a mind that prefers thee and thy love, above all other things; if to love thine appearing, far more than the moſt glorious condition wherein a man can poſſibly appear in mortal fleſh, can find
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50236:156"/>any grace in thine eyes; behold then a ſoul that is able to ſay, through thy great goodneſs, that it moſt earneſtly longs for thee. See here an heart that deſires to be like thee; that had rather dye than diſpleaſe thee: and that will welcome thy coming with more joy, than a ſick man, wearied with the reſtleſſneſs of a long night, doth the morning light; or a Traveller doth his much deſired home; or a Virgin eſpouſed doth her long abſent Bridegroom, the dearly beloved of her ſoul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is thou, who haſt begot in me theſe longings. I have received all thou ſeeſt in me from thy gracious hands; which have made me, and faſhioned me; and made me unſatisfied in any thing, but thee, and thy love. O let not theſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous longings alſo be unſatisfied. Let me not want the pleaſures from which I have turned mine eyes away here; and thoſe pleaſures too, which I look for ſo earneſtly, and promiſe my ſelf at thine appearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let the ſame reaſon which moved thee to give me ſo much, incline thee to give me more. Let that mighty love which hath wrought in me deſires, bring me to the enjoyment. And after thou haſt pleaſed thy bounty, in making me receive as much
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50236:157"/>as thou wilt in this preſent ſtate; let it be thy pleaſure to receive me to thee in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and by giving me all I would have, in the ſight I expect of thee, to leave no deſires remaining in me.</hi> Amen <hi>and</hi> Amen.</p>
